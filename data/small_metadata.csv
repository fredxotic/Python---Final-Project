The GenOSept study was designed to determine genetic influences on sepsis outcome. Phenotypic data was recorded using a robust clinical database allowing a contemporary analysis of the clinical characteristics, microbiology, outcomes and independent risk factors in patients with severe CAP admitted to ICUs across Europe. METHODS: Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine mortality rates. A Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model was used to identify variables independently associated with 28-day and six-month mortality. RESULTS: Data from 1166 patients admitted to 102 centres across 17 countries was extracted. Median age was 64 years, 62% were male. Mortality rate at 28 days was 17%, rising to 27% at six months. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest organism isolated (28% of cases) with no organism identified in 36%. Independent risk factors associated with an increased risk of death at six months included APACHE II score (hazard ratio, HR, 1.03; confidence interval, CI, 1.01-1.05), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (HR1.44; CI 1.11-1.87) and ventilator support (HR 3.04; CI 1.64-5.62). Haematocrit, pH and urine volume on day one were all associated with a worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate in patients with severe CAP admitted to European ICUs was 27% at six months. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest organism isolated. In many cases the infecting organism was not identified. Ventilator support, the presence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, lower haematocrit, urine volume and pH on admission were independent predictors of a worse outcome.",2014-04-01,"Walden, Andrew P; Clarke, Geraldine M; McKechnie, Stuart; Hutton, Paula; Gordon, Anthony C; Rello, Jordi; Chiche, Jean-Daniel; Stueber, Frank; Garrard, Christopher S; Hinds, Charles J",Crit Care,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/666b7a42e5eace656f7b8b9a95c8c72a222fce0b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4056764.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4056764/,

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in ARDS development. New compounds for inhibiting the onset and progression of ARDS are required. Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a small di-peptide with numerous activities, including antioxidant effects, metal chelation, proton buffering capacity and the inhibition of protein carbonylation and glycoxidation. We have examined the preventive effects of carnosine on tissue injury, oedema and inflammation in a murine model for ARDS. Oral administration of carnosine suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced vascular permeability, tissue injury and inflammation in the lung. In vivo imaging analysis revealed that LPS administration increased the level of ROS and that this increase was inhibited by carnosine administration. Carnosine also suppressed LPS-induced neutrophilic inflammation (evaluated by activation of myeloperoxidase in the lung and increased extracellular DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid). Furthermore, carnosine administration suppressed the LPS-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress response in vivo. These results suggest that the oral administration of carnosine suppresses LPS-induced lung injury via carnosine’s ROS-reducing activity. Therefore, carnosine may be beneficial for suppressing the onset and progression of ARDS.",2017-02-16,"Tanaka, Ken-Ichiro; Sugizaki, Toshifumi; Kanda, Yuki; Tamura, Fumiya; Niino, Tomomi; Kawahara, Masahiro",Sci Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8226a506a56979b50b403869d3d1986551470630.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5311717.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5311717/,

Canonical translation of host mRNAs depends on structural elements such as the 5′ cap structure and/or the 3′ poly(A) tail of the mRNAs. Although many viral mRNAs are devoid of one or both of these structures, they can still translate efficiently using non-canonical mechanisms. Here, we review the tools utilized by positive-sense single-stranded (+ss) RNA plant viruses to initiate non-canonical translation, focusing on cis-acting sequences present in viral mRNAs. We highlight how these elements may interact with host translation factors and speculate on their contribution for achieving translational control. We also describe other translation strategies used by plant viruses to optimize the usage of the coding capacity of their very compact genomes, including leaky scanning initiation, ribosomal frameshifting and stop-codon readthrough. Finally, future research perspectives on the unusual translational strategies of +ssRNA viruses are discussed, including parallelisms between viral and host mRNAs mechanisms of translation, particularly for host mRNAs which are translated under stress conditions.",2017-04-06,"Miras, Manuel; Miller, W.

H5 subtype hemagglutinin (HA) has evolved into phylogenetically distinct clades and subclades based on viruses isolated from various avian species. Since 1997, humans have been infected by HPAI H5N1 viruses from several clades. It is, therefore, important to develop strategies to produce protective antibody responses against H5N1 viruses from multiple clades or antigenic groups. In the current study, we optimized the signal peptide design of DNA vaccines expressing HA antigens from H5N1 viruses. Cross reactivity analysis using sera from immunized rabbits showed that antibody responses elicited by a polyvalent formulation, including HA antigens from different clades, was able to elicit broad protective antibody responses against multiple key representative H5N1 viruses across different clades.

Flaviviruses include numerous important human pathogens, e.g., dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Here, we revealed a highly conserved, conformation-tunable cis-acting element named 5′-UAR-flanking stem (UFS) in the flavivirus genomic 5′ terminus. We demonstrated that the UFS was critical for efficient NS5 recruitment and viral RNA synthesis in different flaviviruses. Interestingly, stabilization of the DENV UFS impaired both genome cyclization and vRNA replication. Moreover, the UFS unwound in response to genome cyclization, leading to the decreased affinity of NS5 for the viral 5′ end. Thus, we propose that the UFS is switched by genome cyclization to regulate dynamic RdRp binding for vRNA replication. This study demonstrates that the UFS enables communication between flavivirus genome cyclization and RdRp recruitment, highlighting the presence of switch-like mechanisms among RNA viruses.

Patients infected with macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae usually present with severe M pneumoniae pneumonia. The aim of this study was to identify indicators for whether children at an early stage of M pneumoniae infection develop mild or severe pneumonia. CASE SUMMARY: Herein, we retrospectively reviewed 2 pediatric cases caused by macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae, but with markedly different severity of pneumonia. First, we compared the clinical courses of the patients, then isolated the pathogens and tested their response to macrolides, then finally, carried out whole genome sequencing of these isolates. Despite the difference in clinical presentation of the infection, both isolates exhibited a high level of resistance to macrolide antibiotics. Analysis of clinical data showed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in blood samples of the patients in the early stages of disease varied greatly. Genome sequence analysis revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms mainly focused on adhesin P1, which is involved in the pathogenicity of M pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: The differences of erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the early stage of M pneumoniae pneumonia and mutations in P1 protein may help us to distinguish between severe or mild disease after infection with macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae. These findings could lead to the development of screening assays that will allow us to distinguish severe or mild M pneumoniae pneumonia early.",2016-09-23,"Li, Shaoli; Sun, Hongmei; Liu, Fei; Feng, Yanling; Zhao, Hanqing; Xue, Guanhua; Yan, Chao",Medicine (Baltimore),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/94bb822945a2854f5d541d3b83b5a100f1b7f50a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5044926.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5044926/,

Characterizing the host cytokine response to RSV infection, the regulation of host cytokines and the impact of neutralizing an RSV-inducible cytokine during infection were undertaken in this study. METHODS: A549, primary human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and wild-type, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (Trif) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (Mavs) knockout (KO) mice were infected with RSV and cytokine responses were investigated by ELISA, multiplex analysis and qPCR. Neutralizing anti-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) IgG or control IgG was administered to a group of wild-type animals prior to RSV infection. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: RSV-infected A549 and SAE cells release a network of cytokines, including newly identified RSV-inducible cytokines LIF, migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF), CCL27, CXCL12 and stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF-β). These RSV-inducible cytokines were also observed in the airways of mice during an infection. To identify the regulation of RSV inducible cytokines, Mavs and Trif deficient animals were infected with RSV. In vivo induction of airway IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL5, CCL3, CXCL1, IP-10/CXCL10, IL-22, MIG/CXCL9 and MIF were dependent on Mavs expression in mice. Loss of Trif expression in mice altered the RSV induction of IL-1β, IL-5, CXCL12, MIF, LIF, CXCL12 and IFN-γ. Silencing of retinoic acid–inducible gene-1 (RIG-I) expression in A549 cells had a greater impact on RSV-inducible cytokines than melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), and Trif expression. To evaluate the role of LIF in the airways during RSV infection, animals were treated with neutralizing anti-LIF IgG, which enhanced RSV pathology observed with increased airspace protein content, apoptosis and airway hyperresponsiveness compared to control IgG treatment. CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection in the epithelium induces a network of immune factors to counter infection, primarily in a RIG-I dependent manner. Expression of LIF protects the lung from lung injury and enhanced pathology during RSV infection.

The present study used microarray analysis to compare gene expression levels between allergic rhinitis patients before and after a series of acupoint herbal plaster applications. METHODS: In this experimental pilot study, volunteers experiencing sneezing, runny nose, and congestion for more than 9 months in the year following initial diagnoses were included after diagnostic confirmation by otolaryngologists to exclude patients with sinusitis and nasal polyps. Patients with persistent allergic rhinitis each received four acupoint herbal plaster treatments applied using the moxibustion technique. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). Peripheral blood samples were analyzed using an ImmunoCAP Phadiatop test, and patients were classified as phadiatop (Ph)-positive or -negative. Microarray results were analyzed for genes that were differentially expressed between (1) Ph-positive and -negative patients treated with herbal plaster; and (2) before and after herbal plaster treatment in the Ph-positive patient group. Unsupervised and supervised methods were used for gene-expression data analysis. RESULTS: Nineteen Ph-positive and four Ph-negative participants with persistent allergic rhinitis were included in the study. RQLQ results indicated that the 19 Ph-positive volunteers experienced improvement in six of seven categories following acupoint herbal plaster treatments, whereas the four Ph-negative participants reported improvement in only two categories. Hierarchical clustering and principle component analysis of the gene expression profiles of Ph-positive and –negative participants indicated the groups exhibited distinct physiological responses to acupoint herbal treatment. Evaluation of gene networks using MetaCore identified that the “Immune response_IL-13 signaling via JAK-STAT” and the “Inflammation_Interferon signaling” were down- and up-regulated, respectively, among Ph-positive subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, we find that the IL-13 immune response via JAK-STAT signaling and interferon inflammation signaling were down- and upregulated, respectively, in the Ph-positive group. Further studies are required to verify these pathways in Ph-positive patients, and to determine the mechanism of such pathway dysregulation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02486159.

The important role of TcdR as a sigma factor for toxin expression is undisputed, whereas the role of TcdC as an anti-sigma factor, inhibiting toxin expression, is currently the subject of debate. To clarify the role of TcdC in toxin expression, we generated an isogenic ClosTron-based mutant of tcdC in Clostridium difficile strain 630Δ Erm (CT::tcdC) and determined the transcription levels of the PaLoc genes and the expression levels of the toxins in the wild type strain and the tcdC mutant strain. We found only minor differences in transcription levels of the PaLoc genes between the wild type and CT::tcdC strains and total toxin levels did not significantly differ either.

Therefore, we studied the effects of CMV reactivation on the temporal course of host response biomarkers in patients with sepsis. METHODS: In this matched cohort study, each sepsis patient developing CMV reactivation between day 3 and 17 (CMV+) was compared with one CMV seropositive patient without reactivation (CMVs+) and one CMV seronegative patient (CMVs−). CMV serostatus and plasma loads were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassays and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Systemic interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-18, interferon-gamma–induced protein-10 (IP-10), neutrophilic elastase, IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA), and IL-10 were measured at five time points by multiplex immunoassay. The effects of CMV reactivation on sequential concentrations of these biomarkers were assessed in multivariable mixed models. RESULTS: Among 64 CMV+ patients, 45 could be matched to CMVs+ or CMVs− controls or both. The two baseline characteristics and host response biomarker levels at viremia onset were similar between groups. CMV+ patients had increased IP-10 on day 7 after viremia onset (symmetric percentage difference +44% versus −15% when compared with CMVs+ and +37% versus +4% when compared with CMVs−) and decreased IL-1RA (−41% versus 0% and −49% versus +10%, respectively). However, multivariable analyses did not show an independent association between CMV reactivation and time trends of IL-6, IP-10, IL-10, or IL-1RA. CONCLUSION: CMV reactivation was not independently associated with changes in the temporal trends of host response biomarkers in comparison with non-reactivating patients. Therefore, these markers should not be used as surrogate clinical endpoints for interventional studies evaluating anti-CMV therapy.

Mutational pressure is commonly simplified to genomic GC content; however mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies in different genomes or mRNAs may vary significantly, especially in RNA viruses. A series of in silico shuffling algorithms were developed to account for these features and analyze the relative impact of mutational pressure components on codon usage bias in RNA viruses. Total GC content was a poor descriptor of viral genome composition and causes of codon usage bias. Genomic nucleotide content was the single most important factor of synonymous codon usage. Moreover, the choice between compatible amino acids (e.g., leucine and isoleucine) was strongly affected by genomic nucleotide composition. Dinucleotide composition at codon positions 2-3 had additional effect on codon usage. Together with mononucleotide composition bias, it could explain almost the entire codon usage bias in RNA viruses. On the other hand, strong dinucleotide content bias at codon position 3-1 found in some viruses had very little effect on codon usage. A hypothetical innate immunity sensor for CpG in RNA could partially explain the codon usage bias, but due to dependence of virus translation upon biased host translation machinery, experimental studies are required to further explore the source of dinucleotide bias in RNA viruses.",2013-02-25,"Belalov, Ilya S.; Lukashev, Alexander N.",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/053c632366f418a4f5cee0187d261666c4d99068.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3581513.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3581513/,

We investigated the role of vimentin, a type III intermediate filament, in this process using three well-characterized murine models of ALI known to require NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We demonstrate that central pathophysiologic events in ALI (inflammation, IL-1β levels, endothelial and alveolar epithelial barrier permeability, remodelling and fibrosis) are attenuated in the lungs of Vim(−/−) mice challenged with LPS, bleomycin and asbestos. Bone marrow chimeric mice lacking vimentin have reduced IL-1β levels and attenuated lung injury and fibrosis following bleomycin exposure. Furthermore, decreased active caspase-1 and IL-1β levels are observed in vitro in Vim(−/−) and vimentin-knockdown macrophages. Importantly, we show direct protein–protein interaction between NLRP3 and vimentin. This study provides insights into lung inflammation and fibrosis and suggests that vimentin may be a key regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

These radiation-protective agents, however, have many adverse effects. Efforts have been made to develop new radiation-protective agents for medical application. Here, we investigated whether a compound, polyethylenimine (PEI), which activates Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5)-mediated NF-kB signaling pathways, could have an anti-radiation effect on a mouse model. First, a cell-based screening model for an agonist of TLR5-mediated NF-kB pathway was established and then validated by activation of TLR5-mediated NF-kB luciferase reporter activity with a known TLR5 agonist, flagellin. We found that PEI induced dose-dependent activation of the TLR5-mediated NF-kB pathway, indicating that PEI is indeed a TLR5 agonist. Furthermore, the anti-radiation effect of polyethylenimine was assessed using a γ-ray total body irradiation (TBI) mouse model. Compared with the irradiation control, both survival time and survival rate were significantly improved in mice that received either a low dose of polyethylenimine (P= 0.019) or a high dose of polyethylenimine (P< 0.001). We also observed a positive correlation between animal body weight and survival time in mice that received a low dose of polyethylenimine, a high dose of polyethylenimine and amifostine, over a period of 30 days, r= 0.42 (P< 0.02), 0.72 (P< 0.0001) and 0.95 (P< 0.0001), respectively, while a negative correlation between animal body weight and survival time was observed in the irradiation control (r= –0.89; P< 0.0001).

MP-12 strain, a live-attenuated candidate vaccine, is attenuated in the M- and L-segments, but the S-segment retains the virulent phenotype. MP-12 was manufactured as an Investigational New Drug vaccine by using MRC-5 cells and encodes a functional NSs gene, the major virulence factor of RVFV which 1) induces a shutoff of the host transcription, 2) inhibits interferon (IFN)-β promoter activation, and 3) promotes the degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). MP-12 lacks a marker for differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). Although MP-12 lacking NSs works for DIVA, it does not replicate efficiently in type-I IFN-competent MRC-5 cells, while the use of type-I IFN-incompetent cells may negatively affect its genetic stability. To generate modified MP-12 vaccine candidates encoding a DIVA marker, while still replicating efficiently in MRC-5 cells, we generated recombinant MP-12 encoding Punta Toro virus Adames strain NSs (rMP12-PTNSs) or Sandfly fever Sicilian virus NSs (rMP12-SFSNSs) in place of MP-12 NSs. We have demonstrated that those recombinant MP-12 viruses inhibit IFN-β mRNA synthesis, yet do not promote the degradation of PKR. The rMP12-PTNSs, but not rMP12-SFSNSs, replicated more efficiently than recombinant MP-12 lacking NSs in MRC-5 cells. Mice vaccinated with rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs induced neutralizing antibodies at a level equivalent to those vaccinated with MP-12, and were efficiently protected from wild-type RVFV challenge. The rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs did not induce antibodies cross-reactive to anti-RVFV NSs antibody and are therefore applicable to DIVA. Thus, rMP12-PTNSs is highly efficacious, replicates efficiently in MRC-5 cells, and encodes a DIVA marker, all of which are important for vaccine development for Rift Valley fever.",2013-04-18,"Lihoradova, Olga A.; Indran, Sabarish V.; Kalveram, Birte; Lokugamage, Nandadeva; Head, Jennifer A.; Gong, Bin; Tigabu, Bersabeh; Juelich, Terry L.; Freiberg, Alexander N.; Ikegami, Tetsuro",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7d9f6bae2b7ced5834b4e92e7ef805d85fdea405.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3630143.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630143/,

In human H1N1 viruses that circulated in the first years of the 21st century, this mutation carried a fitness cost and resistant viruses were rare. During the 2007–08 influenza season, oseltamivir-resistant viruses of H1N1 phenotype emerged and predominated. March 2009 saw the emergence of a novel H1N1 influenza pandemic. We examined whether the H275Y mutation affected neuraminidase enzyme activity or replication of the pandemic influenza virus. METHODS: Using reverse genetics we engineered the H275Y mutation into the neuraminidase of a 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and assessed the ability of this enzyme to desialylate mono- and multivalent substrates. The growth kinetics of wild-type and mutant viruses were assessed in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and fully differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cells. RESULTS: The presence of H275Y was associated with a 1.3-fold decrease in the affinity of the neuraminidase for a monovalent substrate and a 4-fold compromise in desialylation of multivalent substrate. This was associated with a fitness cost to viral replication in vitro, which only became apparent during competitive replication in the mucus-rich HAE culture system. CONCLUSIONS: The neuraminidase protein of pandemic influenza isolates tolerates the H275Y mutation and this mutation confers resistance to oseltamivir. However, unlike seasonal H1N1 viruses isolated since 2007, the mutation is not associated with any fitness advantage and thus is unlikely to predominate without further antigenic drift, compensating mutations or intense selection pressure.",2010-12-16,"Brookes, Daniel W.; Miah, Shahajahan; Lackenby, Angie; Hartgroves, Lorian; Barclay, Wendy S.",J Antimicrob Chemother,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/61c544c0073ac03b02ec00b3f4319ff311eb642a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3037153.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037153/,

MD is a chronic infectious disease that threatens the poultry industry. However, the mechanisms of genetic resistance for MD are complex and not completely understood. In this study, to identify high-confidence candidate genes of MD genetic resistance, high throughput sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to obtain transcriptomic data of CD4(+) T cells isolated from MDV-infected and non-infected groups of two reciprocal crosses of individuals mating by two highly inbred chicken lines (6(3) MD-resistant and 7(2) MD-susceptible). After RNA-seq analysis with two biological replicates in each group, we identified 61 and 123 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) annotated in 39 and 132 genes in intercrosses 6(3) × 7(2) and 7(2) × 6(3), respectively, which exhibited allele-specific expression (ASE) in response to MDV infection. Similarly, we identified 62 and 79 SNPs annotated in 66 and 96 genes in infected and non-infected groups, respectively.

Combining the analyses, six genes (MCL1, SLC43A2, PDE3B, ADAM33, BLB1, and DMB2), especially MCL1, were highlighted as the candidate genes with the potential to be involved in MDV infection. Gene-set enrichment analysis revealed that many ASE genes are linked to T cell activation, T cell receptor (TCR), B cell receptor (BCR), ERK/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT-mTOR signaling pathways, which play potentially important roles in MDV infection.

The routine use of LUS limited the number of chest X-ray examinations and decreased transportation to radiology for CT-scan, increasing patient safety and avoiding the transitory disconnection from ventilator. No major complications occurred during ECMO treatments. In three cases, bleeding from vascular access sites due to heparin infusion required blood transfusions. Overall mortality rate was 8.3%. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, early ECMO assistance resulted safe and feasible, considering the life threatening condition, in H1N1-induced ARDS.

Mitigating the spread of such an influenza pandemic would require not only the timely administration of antiviral drugs to those infected, but also the implementation of suitable intervention policies for stunting the spread of the virus. Towards this end, mathematical modelling and simulation studies are crucial as they allow us to evaluate the predicted effectiveness of the various intervention policies before enforcing them. Diagnosis plays a vital role in the overall pandemic management framework by detecting and distinguishing the pathogenic strain from the less threatening seasonal strains and other influenza-like illnesses. This allows treatment and intervention to be deployed effectively, given limited antiviral supplies and other resources. However, the time required to design a fast and accurate testkit for novel strains may limit the role of diagnosis. Herein, we aim to investigate the cost and effectiveness of different diagnostic methods using a stochastic agent-based city-scale model, and then address the issue of whether conventional testing approaches, when used with appropriate intervention policies, can be as effective as fast testkits in containing a pandemic outbreak. We found that for mitigation purposes, fast and accurate testkits are not necessary as long as sufficient medication is given, and are generally recommended only when used with extensive contact tracing and prophylaxis. Additionally, in the event of insufficient medication and fast testkits, the use of slower, conventional testkits together with proper isolation policies while waiting for the diagnostic results can be an equally effective substitute.",2010-07-06,"Chin, Juxin; Koh, Geoffrey; Lee, Dong-Yup",J R Soc Interface,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/dd4007604c49bf0a0933e4dad118b8c5073c8c7f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2880075.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880075/,

SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective, observational study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Records of patients with simple (dystrophic) congenital ptosis who were operated and followed for ≥6 months postoperatively and whose outcomes were deemed as successful were evaluated in the study. Success was defined as a MRD at the last postoperative visit of ≥3 mm. In all cases, levator resection was performed when LF was >4 mm and frontalis suspension when LF was ≤4 mm. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: For statistical evaluations, LF was accepted as the gold standard parameter for deciding on the surgical intervention, and the optimum cutoff point for initial MRD was determined as the point at which sensitivity and specificity was highest at the receiving operating curve for the selection of surgical procedure. RESULTS: Of one hundred and three eyes of ninety patients (44 female/46 male), levator resection was used in 44.7% and frontalis suspension in 55.3%.

Bone is the most common first site of metastatic disease accounting for 40% of all first recurrence and 70% of patients with advanced disease develop skeletal involvement. Treatment of bone metastases currently focusses on symptom relief and prevention and treatment of skeletal complications. However, there remains a need for further treatment options for patients with bone metastases. Combining systemic therapy with a bone-targeted agent, such as radium-223, may provide an effective treatment with minimal additional side effects. METHODS/DESIGN: CARBON is a UK-based, open-label, multi-centre study which comprises an initial safety phase to establish the feasibility and safety of combining radium-223 given on a 6-weekly schedule in combination with orally administered capecitabine followed by a randomised extension phase to further characterise the safety profile and provide preliminary estimation of efficacy. DISCUSSION: The CARBON study is important as the results will be the first to assess radium-223 with chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. If the results find acceptable rates of toxicity with a decrease in bone turnover markers, further work will be necessary in a phase II/III setting to assess the efficacy and clinical benefit.

Both strains pathologically infected neural progenitor cells and glial cells, but not large neurons, with the UR strain also infecting epithelial cells.

This provided a unique opportunity to investigate the antibody response to H1N1pdm09 over time. METHODS: Healthcare workers (HCWs) were immunized with the AS03-adjuvanted H1N1pdm09 vaccine in 2009 (N = 250), and subsequently vaccinated with seasonal vaccines containing H1N1pdm09 for 4 seasons (repeated group), <4 seasons (occasional group), or no seasons (single group). Blood samples were collected pre and at 21 days and 3, 6, and 12 months after each vaccination, or annually (pre-season) from 2010 in the single group. The H1N1pdm09-specific antibodies were measured by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. RESULTS: Pandemic vaccination robustly induced HI antibodies that persisted above the 50% protective threshold (HI titers ≥ 40) over 12 months post-vaccination. Previous seasonal vaccination and the duration of adverse events after the pandemic vaccination influenced the decision to vaccinate in subsequent seasons. During 2010/2011–2013/2014, antibodies were boosted after each seasonal vaccination, although no significant difference was observed between the repeated and occasional groups. In the single group without seasonal vaccination, 32% of HCWs seroconverted (≥4-fold increase in HI titers) during the 4 subsequent years, most of whom had HI titers <40 prior to seroconversion. When excluding these seroconverted HCWs, HI titers gradually declined from 12 to 60 months post–pandemic vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic vaccination elicited durable antibodies, supporting the incorporation of adjuvant. Our findings support the current recommendation of annual influenza vaccination in HCWs.

In ICH patients, hematoma enlargement is the most critical risk factor for poor outcomes. Tranexamic acid, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been used to reduce hematoma expansion. We analyzed the risk factors for hematoma expansion in ICH patients and compared the predictability of hematoma expansion in ICH patients with the use of tranexamic acid. METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of ICH patients who underwent follow-up computed tomography scans from October 2008 to October 2018. Of the 329 included patients, 67 who received tranexamic acid and 262 who did not receive tranexamic acid were compared.

RESULTS: Hematoma expansion was observed in 7 (10.4%) of 67 patients in the tranexamic acid group and 38 (14.5%) of the 262 patients who did not receive tranexamic acid. There was no statistically significant difference between patients who did and did not received tranexamic acid (p=0.389).

A prominent family of ISGs is the interferon-induced with tetratricopeptide repeats (Ifit) genes comprising three members in mice, Ifit1/ISG56, Ifit2/ISG54 and Ifit3/ISG49. Intranasal infection with a low dose of VSV is not lethal to wild-type mice and all three Ifit genes are induced in the central nervous system of the infected mice. We tested their potential contributions to the observed protection of wild-type mice from VSV pathogenesis, by taking advantage of the newly generated knockout mice lacking either Ifit2 or Ifit1. We observed that in Ifit2 knockout (Ifit2 (−/−)) mice, intranasal VSV infection was uniformly lethal and death was preceded by neurological signs, such as ataxia and hind limb paralysis. In contrast, wild-type and Ifit1 (−/−) mice were highly protected and survived without developing such disease. However, when VSV was injected intracranially, virus replication and survival were not significantly different between wild-type and Ifit2(−/−) mice. When administered intranasally, VSV entered the central nervous system through the olfactory bulbs, where it replicated equivalently in wild-type and Ifit2 (−/−) mice and induced interferon-β. However, as the infection spread to other regions of the brain, VSV titers rose several hundred folds higher in Ifit2 (−/−) mice as compared to wild-type mice. This was not caused by a broadened cell tropism in the brains of Ifit2 (−/−) mice, where VSV still replicated selectively in neurons. Surprisingly, this advantage for VSV replication in the brains of Ifit2(−/−) mice was not observed in other organs, such as lung and liver. Pathogenesis by another neurotropic RNA virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, was not enhanced in the brains of Ifit2 (−/−) mice.

To promote the study of HMPV, several groups have generated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing recombinant HMPV strains (HMPV(GFP)). However, the growing evidence has complicated the understanding of cell line specificity of HMPV, because it seems to vary notably among HMPV strains. In addition, unique A2b clade HMPV strains with a 180-nucleotide duplication in the G gene (HMPV A2b(180nt-dup) strains) have recently been detected. In this study, we re-evaluated and compared the cell line specificity of clinical isolates of HMPV strains, including the novel HMPV A2b(180nt-dup) strains, and six recombinant HMPV(GFP) strains, including the newly generated recombinant HMPV A2b(180nt-dup) strain, MG0256-EGFP. Our data demonstrate that VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells generally showed the highest infectivity with any clinical isolates and recombinant HMPV(GFP) strains. Other human-derived cell lines (BEAS-2B, A549, HEK293, MNT-1, and HeLa cells) showed certain levels of infectivity with HMPV, but these were significantly lower than those of VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells. Also, the infectivity in these suboptimal cell lines varied greatly among HMPV strains. The variations were not directly related to HMPV genotypes, cell lines used for isolation and propagation, specific genome mutations, or nucleotide duplications in the G gene.

The oncogenic potential of LMP1 has been ascribed to pleiotropic signaling properties initiated through protein-protein interactions in cytosolic membrane compartments, but the effects of LMP1 extend to nuclear and extracellular processes. Although LMP1 is one of the latent genes required for EBV-immortalization of B cells, the biology of LMP1 in the pathogenesis of the epithelial cancer nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is more complex. NPC is prevalent in specific regions of the world with high incidence in southeast China. The epidemiology and time interval from seroconversion to NPC onset in adults would suggest the involvement of multiple risk factors that complement the establishment of a latent and persistent EBV infection. The contribution of LMP1 to EBV pathogenesis in polarized epithelia has only recently begun to be elucidated. Furthermore, the LMP1 gene has emerged as one of the most divergent sequences in the EBV genome.

In this study, 25 full-length CDV genome sequences were subjected to phylogenetic and recombinational analyses. The results of phylogenetic analysis, intragenic recombination, and nucleotide selection pressure indicated that mutation and recombination occurred in the six individual genes segment (H, F, P, N, L, M) of the CDV genome. The analysis also revealed pronounced genetic diversity in the CDV genome according to the geographically distinct lineages (genotypes), namely Asia-1, Asia-2, Asia-3, Europe, America-1, and America-2. The six recombination events were detected using SimPlot and RDP programs. The analysis of selection pressure demonstrated that a majority of the nucleotides in the CDV individual gene were under negative selection.

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of thoracic fluid content (TFC) as a predictor of weaning outcome. METHODS: An observational cohort study included 64 critically ill surgical patients who were eligible for extubation. Before initiating the spontaneous breathing trial, the TFC was measured using the electrical cardiometry technology. Patients were followed up after extubation and divided into successful weaning group and failed weaning group. Both groups were compared according to respiratory and cardiovascular parameters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the ability of TFC to predict weaning outcome. RESULTS: The number of successfully weaned patients was 41/64 (64%). Twenty (31%) patients had impaired cardiac contractility, and of them, 13/20 (64%) patients were successfully extubated. Both groups, successful weaning group and failed weaning group, were comparable in most of baseline characteristics; however, the TFC was significantly higher in the failed weaning group compared to the successful weaning group. The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) showed moderate predictive ability for the TFC in predicting weaning failure (AUC [95% confidence interval] 0.69 [0.57–0.8], cutoff value > 50 kΩ(−1)), while the predictive ability of TFC was excellent in the subgroup of patients with ejection fraction < 40% (AUC [95% confidence interval 0.93 [0.72–1], cutoff value > 50 kΩ(−1)).

Of all species, pigs are likely to constitute a greater share of the growth in the livestock subsector. However, constraints such as respiratory infectious diseases cause significant economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Compared to industrialized countries, the occurrence and impacts of respiratory diseases on pig production in Africa is under-documented. Hence, knowledge on prevalence and incidence of economically important swine respiratory pathogens in pigs in Africa is necessary to guide interventions for prevention and control. The purpose of this review was to document the current status of research on five important respiratory pathogens of swine in Africa to inform future research and interventions. The pathogens included were porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSv), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) and swine influenza A viruses (IAV). For this review, published articles were obtained using Harzing’s Publish or Perish software tool from GoogleScholar. Articles were also sourced from PubMed, ScienceDirect, FAO and OIE websites. The terms used for the search were Africa, swine or porcine, respiratory pathogens, M. hyopneumoniae, APP, PCV2, PPRSv, IAV, prevention and control. In all, 146 articles found were considered relevant, and upon further screening, only 85 articles were retained for the review. The search was limited to studies published from 2000 to 2019. Of all the studies that documented occurrence of the five respiratory pathogens, most were on IAV (48.4%, n = 15), followed by PCV2 (25.8%, n = 8), PPRSv (19.4%, n = 6), while only one study (3.2%, n = 1) reported APP and M. hyopneumoniae.

Changes in the tissue-specific exosomal protein expression may underlie pathological conditions whereby extracellular matrix turnover and homeostasis is disrupted. Ocular hypertension due to extracellular matrix accumulation in the trabecular meshwork is a hallmark of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma. In the trabecular meshwork, exosomal fibronectin mediates cell matrix interactions at cellular structures called “invadosomes”. Trabecular meshwork cells use invadosomes to turn over their surrounding matrix and maintain passageways for flow of aqueous humor. In this study, we observed that human trabecular meshwork explants treated with dexamethasone released exosomes with significantly reduced amounts of fibronectin bound per exosome. Further, we found that exosome-fibronectin binding is heparan sulfate-dependent, consistent with our observation that trabecular meshwork exosomes are enriched in the heparin/heparan sulfate binding annexins A2 and A6. In this way, dexamethasone-treated explants released exosomes with a significant reduction in annexin A2 and A6 per exosome. Interestingly, we did not detect exosomal matrix metalloproteinases, but we identified abundant dipeptidyl peptidase 4, a serine protease whose activity was reduced on exosomes isolated from dexamethasone-treated explants. Together, our findings demonstrate mechanistically how corticosteroid-induced alterations in exosomal adhesion cargo and properties can account for the pathological matrix accumulation seen in many glaucoma patients.",2016-10-26,"Dismuke, W.

Although much is known about its bone-restricted gene expression pattern and protein biochemical and topological features, little information is available for BRIL physiological function. Two autosomal dominant forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are caused by distinct, but recurrent mutations in the BRIL gene. Yet, the underlying mechanisms by which those mutations lead to OI are still poorly understood. A previous report indicated that BRIL knockout (KO) mice had bone deformities, shortened long bones, and reproductive problems. Here we generated and systematically analyzed the skeletal phenotype of a new global Bril KO/LacZ knockin mouse model. KO mice reproduced and thrived normally up to 12 month of age. The skeletal phenotype of KO and WT littermates was assessed at embryonic (E13.5 to E18.5) and postnatal (2 days, 3 weeks, 3 months and 8 months) time-points. Embryos from E13.5 through to E18.5 showed significant X-Gal staining in all skeletal elements without any apparent patterning anomalies. Although bone deformities were never observed at any postnatal ages, minor and transient differences were noted in terms of bone length and static uCT parameters, but not systematically across all ages and genders. These changes, however, were not accompanied by significant alteration in bone material properties as assessed by a 3-point bending test. In addition, no changes were detected in circulating serum markers of bone turnover (P1NP, CTX-I, and osteocalcin). Gene expression monitoring also revealed no major impact of the loss of BRIL. Further, when mice were challenged with a surgically-induced fracture in tibia, bones repaired equally well in the KO mice as compared to WT. Finally, we showed that BRIL C-terminus is not a bona fide binding site for calcium. In conclusion, our in depth analysis suggest that skeletal patterning, bone mass accrual and remodeling in mice proceeded independent of BRIL.",2017-09-07,"Patoine, Alexa; Husseini, Abdallah; Kasaai, Bahar; Gaumond, Marie-Hélène; Moffatt, Pierre",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/54e56ec5b95cb23c2b682b181bcc66b7fae8aa07.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5589259.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5589259/,

The diagnosis of M. pneumoniae RTIs currently relies on serological methods and/or the detection of bacterial DNA in the upper respiratory tract (URT). It is conceivable, however, that these diagnostic methods also yield positive results if M. pneumoniae is carried asymptomatically in the URT. Positive results from these tests may therefore not always be indicative of a symptomatic infection. The existence of asymptomatic carriage of M. pneumoniae has not been established. We hypothesized that asymptomatic carriage in children exists and investigated whether colonization and symptomatic infection could be differentiated by current diagnostic methods. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study was conducted at the Erasmus MC–Sophia Children's Hospital and the after-hours General Practitioners Cooperative in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Asymptomatic children (n = 405) and children with RTI symptoms (n = 321) aged 3 mo to 16 y were enrolled in a cross-sectional study from July 1, 2008, to November 30, 2011. Clinical data, pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens, and serum samples were collected. The primary objective was to differentiate between colonization and symptomatic infection with M. pneumoniae by current diagnostic methods, especially real-time PCR. M. pneumoniae DNA was detected in 21.2% (95% CI 17.2%–25.2%) of the asymptomatic children and in 16.2% (95% CI 12.2%–20.2%) of the symptomatic children (p = 0.11). Neither serology nor quantitative PCR nor culture differentiated asymptomatic carriage from infection. A total of 202 children were tested for the presence of other bacterial and viral pathogens. Two or more pathogens were found in 56% (63/112) of the asymptomatic children and in 55.5% (50/90) of the symptomatic children. Finally, longitudinal sampling showed persistence of M. pneumoniae in the URT for up to 4 mo. Fifteen of the 21 asymptomatic children with M. pneumoniae and 19 of the 22 symptomatic children with M. pneumoniae in this longitudinal follow-up tested negative after 1 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Although our study has limitations, such as a single study site and limited sample size, our data indicate that the presence of M. pneumoniae in the URT is common in asymptomatic children. The current diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae are unable to differentiate between asymptomatic carriage and symptomatic infection.

During the present study, we evaluated prospectively the potential of cytokines present in plasma from patients with dengue in stratifying disease severity. METHODS: Seventeen-cytokine multiplex fluorescent microbead immunoassay was used for the simultaneous detection in 59 dengue patients. GLM models using bimodal or Gaussian family were determined in order to associate cytokines with clinical manifestations and laboratory diagnosis. RESULTS: IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-7 and GM-CSF were significantly increased in patients with severe clinical manifestations (severe dengue) when compared to mild disease forms (mild dengue). In contrast, increased MIP-1β levels were observed in patients with mild dengue. MIP-1β was also associated with CD56+NK cell circulating rates. IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α and MCP-1 were associated with marked thrombocytopenia. Increased MCP-1 and GM-CSF levels correlated with hypotension. Moreover, MIP-1β and IFN-γ were independently associated with both dengue severity and disease outcome.

One specific pathological finding of ARDS is diffuse alveolar damage. In 2012, in an effort to increase diagnostic specificity, a revised definition of ARDS was published in JAMA. However, no new parameters or biomarkers were adopted by the revised definition. Discriminating between ARDS and other similar diseases is critically important; however, only a few biomarkers are currently available for diagnostic purposes. Furthermore, predicting the severity, response to therapy, or outcome of the illness is also important for developing treatment strategies for each patient.

The nature and severity of disease can vary between clinical cases. Genetic determinants of virulence are likely to contribute to differences in the in vivo phenotype of FHV-1 isolates, but to date there have been limited studies investigating FHV-1 genetic diversity. This study used next generation sequencing to compare the genomes of contemporary Australian clinical isolates of FHV-1, vaccine isolates and historical clinical isolates, including isolates that predated the introduction of live attenuated vaccines into Australia. Analysis of the genome sequences aimed to assess the level of genetic diversity, identify potential genetic markers that could influence the in vivo phenotype of the isolates and examine the sequences for evidence of recombination. RESULTS: The full genome sequences of 26 isolates of FHV-1 were determined, including two vaccine isolates and 24 clinical isolates that were collected over a period of approximately 40 years. Analysis of the genome sequences revealed a remarkably low level of diversity (0.0–0.01 %) between the isolates. No potential genetic determinants of virulence were identified, but unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the UL28 and UL44 genes were detected in the vaccine isolates that were not present in the clinical isolates. No evidence of FHV-1 recombination was detected using multiple methods of recombination detection, even though many of the isolates originated from cats housed in a shelter environment where high infective pressures were likely to exist. Evidence of displacement of dominant FHV-1 isolates with other (genetically distinct) FHV-1 isolates over time was observed amongst the isolates obtained from the shelter-housed animals. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that FHV-1 genomes are highly conserved. The lack of recombination detected in the FHV-1 genomes suggests that the risk of attenuated vaccines recombining to generate virulent field viruses is lower than has been suggested for some other herpesviruses. The SNPs detected only in the vaccine isolates offer the potential to develop PCR-based methods of differentiating vaccine and clinical isolates of FHV-1 in order to facilitate future epidemiological studies.

It exhibits measurable levels of cytotoxicity, with 50% cytotoxic concentration values ranging from 7.5 μM in CEM cells and up to >100 μM in other cell lines. The mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POLRMT) has been shown to incorporate some nucleotide analogs into mitochondrial RNAs, resulting in substantial mitochondrial toxicity. NHC was tested in multiple assays intended to determine its potential to cause mitochondrial toxicity. NHC showed similar cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells incubated in a glucose-free and glucose-containing media, suggesting that NHC does not impair mitochondrial function in this cell line based on the Crabtree effect. We demonstrate that the 5′-triphosphate of NHC can be used by POLRMT for incorporation into nascent RNA chain but does not cause immediate chain termination. In PC-3 cells treated with NHC, the 50% inhibitory concentrations of mitochondrial protein expression inhibition were 2.7-fold lower than those for nuclear-encoded protein expression, but this effect did not result in selective mitochondrial toxicity. A 14-day incubation of HepG2 cells with NHC had no effect on mitochondrial DNA copy number or extracellular lactate levels. In CEM cells treated with NHC at 10 μM, a slight decrease (by ∼20%) in mitochondrial DNA copy number and a corresponding slight increase in extracellular lactate levels were detected, but these effects were not enhanced by an increase in NHC treatment concentration.

One aspect of care that has potential to affect all of the above is postoperative mechanical ventilation. Historically, postoperative ventilation was considered a must for maintaining patient stability. Ironically, it is recognized that mechanical ventilation may increase risk of adverse outcomes in the postoperative period. Hence, many institutions have advocated for immediate extubation or early extubation after many congenital heart surgeries which was first reported decades ago. METHODS: 637 consecutive patient charts were reviewed for pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were placed into three groups. Those that were extubated in the operating room (OR) at the conclusion of surgery (Immediate Extubation or IE), those that were extubated within six hours of admission to the ICU (Early Extubation or EE) and those that were extubated sometime after six hours (Delayed Extubation or DE). Multiple variables were then recorded to see which factors correlated with successful Immediate or Early Extubation. RESULTS: Overall, 338 patients (53.1%) had IE), 273 (42.8%) had DE while only 26 patients (4.1%) had EE. The median age was 1174 days for the IE patients, 39 days for the DE patients, whereas 194 days for EE patients (p < 0.001). Weight and length were also significantly different in at least one extubation group from the other two (p < 0.001). The median ICU LOS was 3 and 4 days for IE and EE patients respectively, whereas it was 9.5 days for DE patients (p < 0.001). DE group had a significant longer median anesthesia time and cardiopulmonary bypass time than the other two extubation groups (p > 63,826.88 < 0.001). Regional low flow perfusion, deep hypothermia, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, redo sternotomy, use of other sedatives, furosemide, epinephrine, vasopressin, open chest, cardiopulmonary support, pulmonary edema, syndrome, as well as difficult intubation were significantly associated with delayed extubation (IE, EE or DE). CONCLUSIONS: Immediate and early extubation was significantly associated with several factors, including patient age and size, duration of CPB, use of certain anesthetic drugs, and the amount of blood loss and blood replacement. IE can be successfully accomplished in a majority of pediatric patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease, including in a minority of infants.",2020-01-06,"Tirotta, Christopher F.; Alcos, Stephen; Lagueruela, Richard G.; Salyakina, Daria; Wang, Weize; Hughes, Jessica; Irizarry, Marysory; Burke, Redmond P.",J Cardiothorac Surg,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/73b9d1b4a34bcb7e716d2dfeedd4c557cba87203.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6945478.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6945478/,

We assess hybridization specificity by comparing the relative hybridization signals from probes perfectly matched to ATM sequences to those containing mismatches. Probes complementary to two base substitutions displayed the highest average specificity followed by those complementary to single base substitutions, single base deletions and single base insertions. In all the cases, hybridization specificity was strongly influenced by sequence context and possible intra- and intermolecular probe and/or target structure. Furthermore, single nucleotide substitution probes displayed the most consistent hybridization specificity data followed by single base deletions, two base deletions and single nucleotide insertions.

HA binds to a virus receptor, a sialoglycoprotein or sialoglycolipid, on the host cell and mediates virus attachment to the cell surface. The hydrolytic enzyme NA cleaves sialic acid from viral receptors and accelerates the release of progeny virus from host cells. In this study, we identified a novel function of HA and NA as machinery for viral motility. HAs exchanged binding partner receptors iteratively, generating virus movement on a receptor-coated glass surface instead of a cell surface. The virus movement was also dependent on NA. Virus movement mediated by HA and NA resulted in a three to four-fold increase in virus internalisation by cultured cells.

We sought to further investigate the relationship between WU and KI infection and respiratory disease in a pediatric population with respiratory symptoms in Singapore. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms in a Singaporean pediatrics hospital. Upon consent, residual respiratory samples from pediatric inpatients, previously screened for common respiratory viruses, were collected and further screened for WU and KI using qPCR. The amplicons of positive samples were sequenced for confirmation. The severity of a patient's illness was assessed by chart review post-discharge looking for clinical markers of respiratory status such as presenting symptoms, diagnoses, and interventions. Results: From December 2016 to April 2017, 201 patients with residual respiratory samples were enrolled in the study. The average age of all participants recruited was 45 months.

There has been a growing concern over the role of bioaerosols in spread of various airborne infections and also to reduce the risk of bioaerosol contamination. AIMS: This study was to analyze the number of colony forming units (CFUs) in bioaerosols generated during ultrasonic scaling procedure as well as to evaluate the efficacy of chlorhexidine 0.12% (CHX) preprocedural mouth rinse and high volume evacuator (HVE) in minimizing the bioaerosol contamination. METHODS: About 45 individuals were divided into three Groups A, B and C. These groups underwent ultrasonic scaling before and after the use of CHX (0.12%), HVE and combination of CHX (0.12%) and HVE. Bioaerosols were collected on blood agar plates which were incubated at 37°C for 48 h, and the CFUs were counted with manual colony counting device. A comparison was also done between A versus B, B versus C and A versus C groups. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Student's t-test. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in the CFUs when CHX (0.12%) preprocedural rinse (P < 0), or HVE (P < 0.001) or combination of both CHX (0.12%) and HVE were employed (P < 0.001). Maximum reduction in CFUs was observed when CHX (0.12%) and HVE were used in combination as compared to their individual use. A moderate significance was seen between A versus C groups but not with B versus C groups and A versus B groups.

Despite an intensive vaccination program, influenza infections remain a recurrent, yet unsolved public health problem. Secondary bacterial infections frequently complicate influenza infections during seasonal outbreaks and pandemics, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is frequently associated with these co-infections, including the 2009 influenza pandemic. Damage to alveolar epithelium is a major contributor to severe influenza-bacterial co-infections and can result in gas exchange abnormalities, fluid leakage, and respiratory insufficiency. These deleterious manifestations likely involve both pathogen- and host-mediated mechanisms. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the mechanisms (pathogen- and/or host-mediated) underlying influenza-bacterial co-infection pathogenesis. To address this, we characterized the contributions of viral-, bacterial-, and host-mediated factors to the altered structure and function of alveolar epithelial cells during co-infection with a focus on the 2009 pandemic influenza (pdm2009) and MRSA. Here, we characterized pdm2009 and MRSA replication kinetics, temporal host kinome responses, modulation of MRSA virulence factors, and disruption of alveolar barrier integrity in response to pdm2009-MRSA co-infection.

Indicators of preparedness were developed based on WHO planning guidance and these were set within a simple assessment which included a formal country visit. The procedure evolved considerably with field experience. As the complexity of pandemic preparedness was appreciated it changed from being a classical short external assessment to longer national self-assessments with demonstrable impact, especially when self-assessments were published. There were essential supporting activities undertaken including a series of pan-European pandemic preparedness workshops organised by EC, WHO-Euro, ECDC and countries holding the European Union Presidency. The self-assessments highlighted additional work and documentation that was needed by national authorities from the ECDC. This work was undertaken and the document produced.

While vaccines offer the potential to control avian disease, a major concern of current vaccines is their potency and inability to protect against evolving avian influenza viruses. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The ability of DNA vaccines encoding hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from different HPAI H5N1 serotypes was evaluated for its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies and to protect against homologous and heterologous HPAI H5N1 strain challenge in mice and chickens after DNA immunization by needle and syringe or with a pressure injection device. These vaccines elicited antibodies that neutralized multiple strains of HPAI H5N1 when given in combinations containing up to 10 HAs. The response was dose-dependent, and breadth was determined by the choice of the influenza virus HA in the vaccine. Monovalent and trivalent HA vaccines were tested first in mice and conferred protection against lethal H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 challenge 68 weeks after vaccination. In chickens, protection was observed against heterologous strains of HPAI H5N1 after vaccination with a trivalent H5 serotype DNA vaccine with doses as low as 5 µg DNA given twice either by intramuscular needle injection or with a needle-free device. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: DNA vaccines offer a generic approach to influenza virus immunization applicable to multiple animal species. In addition, the ability to substitute plasmids encoding different strains enables rapid adaptation of the vaccine to newly evolving field isolates.",2008-06-18,"Rao, Srinivas; Kong, Wing-Pui; Wei, Chih-Jen; Yang, Zhi-Yong; Nason, Martha; Styles, Darrel; DeTolla, Louis J.; Sorrell, Erin M.; Song, Haichen; Wan, Hongquan; Ramirez-Nieto, Gloria C.; Perez, Daniel; Nabel, Gary J.",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ef872b80cf38917f64c42bfa52a57beb4399897a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2657001.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657001/,

However, the identification of single-nucleotide variations capable of distinguishing a sequence among a set of homologous ones can be problematic. Here we present ORMA (Oligonucleotide Retrieving for Molecular Applications), a set of scripts for discriminating positions search and for performing the selection of high-quality oligonucleotide probes to be used in molecular applications. Two assays based on Ligase Detection Reaction (LDR) are presented. First, a new set of probe pairs on cyanobacteria 16S rRNA sequences of 18 different species was compared to that of a previous study. Then, a set of LDR probe pairs for the discrimination of 13 pathogens contaminating bovine milk was evaluated. The software determined more than 100 candidate probe pairs per dataset, from more than 300 16S rRNA sequences, in less than 5 min. Results demonstrated how ORMA improved the performance of the LDR assay on cyanobacteria, correctly identifying 12 out of 14 samples, and allowed the perfect discrimination among the 13 milk pathogenic-related species.

However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the exchange of genetic material is not limited to the transfer from parent to offspring but can also occur through horizontal transfer (HT). Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA fragments with an innate propensity for HT; they are mobile and possess parasitic characteristics that allow them to exist and proliferate within host genomes. However, horizontal transposon transfer (HTT) is not easily detected, primarily because the complex TE life cycle can generate phylogenetic patterns similar to those expected for HTT events. The increasingly large number of new genome projects, in all branches of life, has provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the TE content and HTT events in these species, although a standardized method of HTT detection is required before trends in the HTT rates can be evaluated in a wide range of eukaryotic taxa and predictions about these events can be made. Thus, we propose a straightforward hypothesis test that can be used by TE specialists and nonspecialists alike to discriminate between HTT events and natural TE life cycle patterns. We also discuss several plausible explanations and predictions for the distribution and frequency of HTT and for the inherent biases of HTT detection. Finally, we discuss some of the methodological concerns for HTT detection that may result in the underestimation and overestimation of HTT rates during eukaryotic genome evolution.",2012-07-12,"Wallau, Gabriel Luz; Ortiz, Mauro Freitas; Loreto, Elgion Lucio Silva",Genome Biol Evol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1ae3c51a5e1057f20b5e37b7e5e21d1aa9d979d2.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3516303.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3516303/,

The animals, six weeks old and clinically healthy, were inoculated with the virulent strain Margarita (secondary virus). For exclusive detection of the Margarita strain, a specific qRT-PCR assay was designed, which proved not to have cross-reactivity with the Cat01 strain. The wild boars persistently infected with CSFV were protected from superinfection by the virulent CSFV Margarita strain, as evidenced by the absence of clinical signs and the absence of Margarita RNA detection in serum, swabs and tissue samples. Additionally, in PBMCs, a well-known target for CSFV viral replication, only the primary infecting virus RNA (Cat01 strain) could be detected, even after the isolation in ST cells, demonstrating SIE at the tissue level in vivo. Furthermore, the data analysis of the Margarita qRT-PCR, by means of calculated ΔCt values, supported that PBMCs from persistently infected animals were substantially protected from superinfection after in vitro inoculation with the Margarita virus strain, while this virus was able to infect naive PBMCs efficiently. In parallel, IFN-α values were undetectable in the sera from animals in Group B after inoculation with the CSFV Margarita strain. Furthermore, these animals were unable to elicit adaptive humoral (no E2-specific or neutralising antibodies) or cellular immune responses (in terms of IFN-γ-producing cells) after inoculation with the second virus. Finally, a sequence analysis could not detect CSFV Margarita RNA in the samples tested from Group B. Our results suggested that the SIE phenomenon might be involved in the evolution and phylogeny of the virus, as well as in CSFV control by vaccination.

Among them, gossypol exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity against almost all 10 ZIKV strains tested, including six recent epidemic human strains. The mechanistic study indicated that gossypol could neutralize ZIKV infection by targeting the envelope protein domain III (EDIII) of ZIKV. In contrast, the other natural products inhibited ZIKV infection by targeting the host cell or cell-associated entry and replication stages of ZIKV. A combination of gossypol with any of the three natural products identified in this study, as well as with bortezomib, a previously reported anti-ZIKV compound, exhibited significant combinatorial inhibitory effects against three ZIKV human strains tested. Importantly, gossypol also demonstrated marked potency against all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) human strains in vitro.

They not only specialize in the production of ribosomal subunits but also play roles in many fundamental cellular activities. Concerning ribosome biosynthesis, particular stages of this process, i.e., ribosomal DNA transcription, primary RNA transcript processing, and ribosome assembly proceed in precisely defined nucleolar subdomains. Although eukaryotic nucleoli are conservative in respect of their main function, clear morphological differences between these structures can be noticed between individual kingdoms. In most cases, a plant nucleolus shows well-ordered structure in which four main ultrastructural components can be distinguished: fibrillar centers, dense fibrillar component, granular component, and nucleolar vacuoles. Nucleolar chromatin is an additional crucial structural component of this organelle. Nucleolonema, although it is not always an unequivocally distinguished nucleolar domain, has often been described as a well-grounded morphological element, especially of plant nucleoli. The ratios and morphology of particular subcompartments of a nucleolus can change depending on its metabolic activity which in turn is correlated with the physiological state of a cell, cell type, cell cycle phase, as well as with environmental influence.

METHODS: We were investigated the effects of Q7R on the cytopathic effects (CPE) by CPE reduction assay. Production of DNA fragment and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by PEDV infection were studied using DNA fragmentation assay and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In the course of this study it was discovered that Q7R is an extremely potent compound against PEDV. The addition of Q7R to PEDV-infected Vero cells directly reduced the formation of a visible cytopathic effect (CPE). Also, Q7R did not induce DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, ROS increased the infection of PEDV, which was strongly decreased by N-acetyl-L-cysteins (NAC). However, the increased ROS was not decreased by Q7R. Antiviral activity of antioxidants such as NAC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), and the vitamin E derivative, trolox, were hardly noticed. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the inhibition of PEDV production by Q7R is not simply due to a general action as an antioxidants and is highly specific, as several other antioxidants (NAC, PDTC, trolox) are inactive against PEDV infection.",2011-10-04,"Song, Jae Hyoung; Shim, Jae Kwon; Choi, Hwa Jung",Virol J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/478eaa49054cba8f6ec4f2df3c6bfddd171e6ac5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3200163.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3200163/,

Currently, available technology manufactures artificial blood from haemoglobin obtained from outdated human/bovine blood (Haemoglobin Based Oxygen Carriers) or utilizing Perfluorocarbons. These synthetic blood substitutes are advantageous in that they do not require compatibility testing, are free from blood borne infections, have prolonged shelf life and do not require refrigeration. Artificial blood is projected to have a significant impact on the development of medical care in the future. It can complement the current blood products for transfusion and create a stable supply of safe and effective products.

Stress response can either repair the damage or activate one of the programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms, for example apoptosis, and finally end in cell death. One striking characteristic, which accompanies apoptosis in both vertebrates and yeast, is a fragmentation of cellular DNA and mammalian apoptosis is often associated with degradation of different RNAs. We show that in yeast exposed to stimuli known to induce apoptosis, such as hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, hyperosmotic stress and ageing, two large subunit ribosomal RNAs, 25S and 5.8S, became extensively degraded with accumulation of specific intermediates that differ slightly depending on cell death conditions. This process is most likely endonucleolytic, is correlated with stress response, and depends on the mitochondrial respiratory status: rRNA is less susceptible to degradation in respiring cells with functional defence against oxidative stress. In addition, RNA fragmentation is independent of two yeast apoptotic factors, metacaspase Yca1 and apoptosis-inducing factor Aif1, but it relies on the apoptotic chromatin condensation induced by histone H2B modifications.

Generally, an insect vector can use autophagy as an intrinsic antiviral defense mechanism against viral infection. Whether viruses can evolve to exploit autophagy to promote their transmission by insect vectors is still unknown. Here, we show that the autophagic process is triggered by the persistent replication of a plant reovirus, rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) in cultured leafhopper vector cells and in intact insects, as demonstrated by the appearance of obvious virus-containing double-membrane autophagosomes, conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II and increased level of autophagic flux. Such virus-containing autophagosomes seem able to mediate nonlytic viral release from cultured cells or facilitate viral spread in the leafhopper intestine. Applying the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or silencing the expression of Atg5 significantly decrease viral spread in vitro and in vivo, whereas applying the autophagy inducer rapamycin or silencing the expression of Torc1 facilitate such viral spread. Furthermore, we find that activation of autophagy facilitates efficient viral transmission, whereas inhibiting autophagy blocks viral transmission by its insect vector. Together, these results indicate a plant virus can induce the formation of autophagosomes for carrying virions, thus facilitating viral spread and transmission by its insect vector. We believe that such a role for virus-induced autophagy is common for vector-borne persistent viruses during their transmission by insect vectors.",2017-11-10,"Chen, Yong; Chen, Qian; Li, Manman; Mao, Qianzhuo; Chen, Hongyan; Wu, Wei; Jia, Dongsheng; Wei, Taiyun",PLoS Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b92029ab36511c3072b0a3cba99c6dbca29097cf.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5708841.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5708841/,

Here, we expressed and purified RID from human LysRS (hRID) in Escherichia coli and performed a detailed mutagenesis of the appended domain. hRID was co-purified with nucleic acids during Ni-affinity purification, and cumulative mutations on critical amino acid residues abolished RNA binding. Furthermore, we identified a structural ensemble between disordered and helical structures in non-RNA-binding mutants and an equilibrium shift for wild-type into the helical conformation upon RNA binding.

To improve the outcome of ARDS, accurate diagnosis is essential to the application of effective early treatment. The present study investigated the clinical effects and safety of open lung biopsy (OLB) in patients with early-stage ARDS of suspected non-infectious origin. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study of 41 patients with early-stage ARDS (defined as one week or less after intubation) who underwent OLB in two medical intensive care units of a tertiary care hospital from 1999 to 2005. Data analyzed included baseline characteristics, complication rate, pathological diagnoses, treatment alterations, and hospital survival. RESULTS: The age of patients was 55 ± 17 years (mean ± SD). The average ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) was 116 ± 43 mmHg (mean ± SD) at biopsy. Seventeen patients (41%) were immunocompromised. Postoperative complications occurred in 20% of patients (8/41). All biopsies provided a pathological diagnosis with a diagnostic yield of 100%. Specific pathological diagnoses were made for 44% of patients (18/41). Biopsy findings led to an alteration of treatment modality in 73% of patients (30/41). The treatment alteration rate was higher in patients with nonspecific diagnoses than in patients with specific diagnoses (p = 0.0024). Overall mortality was 50% (21/41) and was not influenced by age, gender, pre-OLB oxygenation, complication rate, pathological results, and alteration of treatment. There was no surgery-related mortality. The survival rate for immunocompromised patients was better than that for immunocompetent patients (71% versus 33%; p = 0.0187) in this study.

He was admitted to the intensive care unit and initially treated with a 1-day course of intravenous quinine followed by oral chloroquine and primaquine. The patient’s platelet count increased as early as 4 hours after treatment inception and the clinical course was favourable and uneventful. DISCUSSION: This case report, along with a review of published cases focusing on the relationship between thrombocytopaenia and severe P. vivax malaria, suggests that the prognostic role of severe thrombocytopaenia is ambiguous in absence of severe haemorraghic complications and its use as diagnostic criterion of malaria severity may lead to overestimation of severe P. vivax malaria cases.

Such patients are often admitted in a context of acute-on-chronic liver failure with extrahepatic failures. Sequential assessment of scores or classification based on organ failures within the first days after admission help to stratify the risk of mortality in this population. Although the prognosis of severely ill cirrhotic patients has recently improved, transplant-free mortality remains high. LT is still the only curative treatment in this population. Yet, the increased relative scarcity of graft resource must be considered alongside the increased risk of losing a graft in the initial postoperative period when performing LT in “too sick to transplant” patients. Variables associated with poor immediate post-LT outcomes have been identified in large studies. Despite this, the performance of scores based on these variables is still insufficient. Consideration of a patient’s comorbidities and frailty is an appealing predictive approach in this population that has proven of great value in many other diseases. So far, local expertise remains the last safeguard to LT. Using this expertise, data are accumulating on favourable post-LT outcomes in very high MELD populations, particularly when LT is performed in a situation of stabilization/improvement of organ failures in selected candidates. The absence of “definitive” contraindications and the control of “dynamic” contraindications allow a “transplantation window” to be defined. This window must be identified swiftly after admission given the poor short-term survival of patients with very high MELD scores.

A mutational analysis was performed to test the functional importance of the triple helix for −1 frameshifting in vitro. Changing bases in L2 or base pairs in S1 involved in a base triple resulted in a 2- to 5-fold decrease in frameshifting efficiency. Alterations in the length of L2 had adverse effects on frameshifting. The in vitro effects were well reproduced in vivo, although the effect of enlarging L2 was more dramatic in vivo. The putative role of refolding kinetics of frameshifter pseudoknots is discussed. Overall, the data emphasize the role of the triple helix in −1 frameshifting.",2010-07-17,"Olsthoorn, René C.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and the acute clinical manifestations represent acute on chronic inflammation. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is found in the granules of human neutrophils, with many diverse functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that levels NGAL in blood may reflect the inflammatory process in various stages of coronary artery disease. Methods. We studied 140 patients, with SA 40, UA 35, NSTEMI 40, and STEMI 25, and 20 healthy controls. Serum NGAL was measured upon admission and before coronary angiography. Results. Significant differences were observed in median serum-NGAL(ng/mL) between patients with SA (79.23 (IQR, 37.50–100.32)), when compared with UA (108.00 (68.34–177.59)), NSTEMI (166.49 (109.24–247.20)), and STEMI (178.63 (111.18–305.92)) patients and controls (50.31 (44.30–69.78)) with significant incremental value from SA to STEMI. We observed a positive and significant correlation between serum-NGAL and hs-CRP (spearman coefficient rho = 0.685, P < 0.0001) as well as with neutrophil counts (r = 0.511, P < 0.0001). Conclusions. In patients with coronary artery disease serum levels of NGAL increase and reflect the degree of inflammatory process.

The ongoing human outbreak of avian H7N9 in China highlights the need for increased surveillance and control in these live-bird markets (LBMs). DISCUSSION: Closure of retail markets in affected areas rapidly decreased human cases to rare, sporadic occurrence, but little attention has been paid thus far to the role of upstream elements of the poultry distribution chain such as wholesale markets. This could partly explain why transmission in poultry populations has not been eliminated more broadly. We present surveillance data from both wholesale live-bird markets (wLBMs) and rLBMs in Shantou, China (from 2004–2006), and call on disease-dynamic theory to illustrate why closing rLBMs has only minor effects on the overall volume of transmission. We show that the length of time birds stay in rLBMs can severely limit transmission there, but that the system-wide effect may be reduced substantially by high levels of transmission upstream of retail markets. SUMMARY: Management plans that minimize transmission throughout the entire poultry supply chain are essential for minimizing exposure to the public. These include reducing stay-time of birds in markets to 1 day, standardizing poultry supply chains to limit transmission in pre-retail settings, and monitoring strains with epidemiological traits that pose a high risk of emergence. These actions will further limit human exposure to extant viruses and reduce the likelihood of the emergence of novel strains by decreasing the overall volume of transmission.",2013-12-16,"Pepin, Kim M; Lloyd-Smith, James O; Webb, Colleen T; Holcomb, Karen; Zhu, Huachen; Guan, Yi; Riley, Steven",BMC Infect Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d23a5e1b6a5c6036c3e45e7c6d9019a59ddfd6bd.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3878446.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878446/,

The damage caused by the disease and our treatments for the patients often leave them physically and cognitively debilitated. Generally, GBMs appear after very short clinical histories and are discovered by imaging (using magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and the diagnosis is validated by pathology, following surgical resection. The treatment response and diagnosis of tumor recurrence are also tracked by MRI, but there are numerous problems encountered with these monitoring modalities, such as ambiguous interpretation and forms of pseudoprogression. Diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers would be an immense boon in following treatment schemes and in determining recurrence, which often requires an invasive intracranial biopsy to verify imaging data. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are stable, membrane-enclosed, virus-sized particles released from either the cell surface or from endosomal pathways that lead to the systemic release of EVs into accessible biofluids, such as serum/plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva. EVs carry a wide variety of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other metabolites, with many common features but with enough individuality to be able to identify the cell of origin of the vesicles. These components, if properly interrogated, could allow for the identification of tumor-derived EVs in biofluids, indicating tumor progression, relapse, or treatment failure. That knowledge would allow clinicians to continue with treatment regimens that were actually effective or to change course if the therapies were failing.

One mechanism is molecular mimicry, where a foreign antigen shares sequence or structural similarities with self-antigens. Molecular mimicry has typically been characterized on an antibody or T cell level. However, structural relatedness between pathogen and self does not account for T cell activation in a number of autoimmune diseases. A proposed mechanism that could have been misinterpreted for molecular mimicry is the expression of dual T cell receptors (TCR) on a single T cell. These T cells have dual reactivity to both foreign and self-antigens leaving the host vulnerable to foreign insults capable of triggering an autoimmune response. In this review, we briefly discuss what is known about molecular mimicry followed by a discussion of the current understanding of dual TCRs.

Csk partially colocalized with viral replication compartments. Dengue infection was drastically reduced in cells lacking the three ubiquitous src family kinases, Src, Fyn and Yes. Csk knock-down in these cells failed to block dengue virus replication suggesting that the effect of Csk is via regulation of Src family kinases.

The present study aimed to address these issues and estimate the HIV incidence and the proportion of diagnosed HIV infections, using a simple statistical model. METHODS: From among Japanese nationals, yearly incidence data of HIV diagnoses and patients with AIDS who had not previously been diagnosed as HIV positive, from 1985 to 2017, were analyzed. Using the McKendrick partial differential equation, general convolution-like equations were derived, allowing estimation of the HIV incidence and the time-dependent rate of diagnosis. A likelihood-based approach was used to obtain parameter estimates. RESULTS: Assuming that the median incubation period was 10.0 years, the cumulative number of HIV infections was estimated to be 29,613 (95% confidence interval (CI): 29,059, 30,167) by the end of 2017, and the proportion of diagnosed HIV infections was estimated at 80.3% (95% CI [78.7%–82.0%]). Allowing the median incubation period to range from 7.5 to 12.3 years, the estimate of the proportion diagnosed can vary from 77% to 84%. DISCUSSION: The proportion of diagnosed HIV infections appears to have not yet reached 90% among Japanese nationals. Compared with the peak incidence from 2005–2008, new HIV infections have clearly been in a declining trend; however, there are still more than 1,000 new HIV infections per year in Japan.

Among the complex taxa, Cx. pipiens (with two forms pipiens and molestus) and Cx. quinquefasciatus are the most ubiquitous mosquitoes in temperate and tropical regions respectively. Mosquitoes of this taxa lack of morphological differences between females, but have frank behavioral and physiological differences and have different trophic preferences that influence their vectorial status. Hybridization may change the vectorial capacity of these mosquitoes, increasing vector efficiency and medical importance of resulting hybrids. METHODS: Culex pipiens s.l. from 35 distinct populations were investigated by the study of mtDNA, symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis, nuclear DNA and flanking region of microsatellite CQ11 polymorphism using PCR with diagnostic primers, RFLP analysis and sequencing. RESULTS: Six different mitochondrial haplotypes were revealed by sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and three different Wolbachia (wPip) groups were identified. A strong association was observed between COI haplotypes/groups, wPip groups and taxa; haplogroup A and infection with wPipII appear to be typical for Cx. pipiens form pipiens, haplotype D and infection with wPipIV for form molestus, while haplogroup E, characteristic of Cx. quinquefasciatus, were correlated with wPipI and found in Cx. pipiens sl. from coastal regions of Southern Europe and Mediterranean region. Analysis of microsatellite locus and nuclear DNA revealed hybrids between Cx. pipiens form pipiens and form molestus, as well as between Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus, in Mediterranean populations, as opposed to Northern Europe. Phylogenetic analysis of COI sequences yielded a tree topology that supported the RFLP analysis with significant bootstrap values for haplotype D and haplogroup E. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular identification provides the first evidence of the presence of hybrids between Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens as well as cytoplasmic introgression of Cx. quinquefasciatus into Cx. pipiens as a result of hybridization events in coastal regions of Southern Europe and Mediterranean region. Together with observed hybrids between pipiens and molestus forms, these findings point to the presence of hybrids in these areas, with consequent higher potential for disease transmission.

Using this vector that also expresses enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) as surrogate marker, stable shRNA-expressing cell lines were successfully established and the inhibition efficiencies of rationally designed siRNAs targeting to conserved regions of influenza A virus genome were assessed. The results showed that a siRNA targeting influenza M2 gene (siM2) potently inhibited viral replication.

In addition to its M2 inhibition, the siM2 also inhibited NP mRNA accumulation and protein expression. A long term inhibition effect of the siM2 was demonstrated and the emergence of siRNA-resistant mutants in influenza quasispecies was not observed.

We previously reported that FcRn is expressed in a model of normal porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). Transmissible gastroenteritis is an acute enteric disease of swine that is caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). How porcine FcRn (pFcRn) expression is regulated by pathogenic infection remains unknown. Our research shows that IPEC-J2 cells infected with TGEV had up-regulated pFcRn expression. In addition, the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated in IPEC-J2 cells by TGEV infection. Furthermore, treatment of TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells with the NF-κB-specific inhibitor BAY 11-7082 resulted in down-regulation of pFcRn expression. Transient transfection of pFcRn promoter luciferase report plasmids with overexpression of NF-κB p65 transcription factor enhanced the activation of the luciferase report plasmids.

Studies thus far have focused on bacterial or eukaryotic pathogens as the source of these diseases; no studies have examined the role of viruses. Using a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 454 pyrosequencing, we compared 24 viral metagenomes generated from Montastraea annularis corals showing signs of WP-like disease and/or bleaching, control conspecific corals, and adjacent seawater. TEM was used for visual inspection of diseased coral tissue. No bacteria were visually identified within diseased coral tissues, but viral particles and sequence similarities to eukaryotic circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA viruses and their associated satellites (SCSDVs) were abundant in WP diseased tissues. In contrast, sequence similarities to SCSDVs were not found in any healthy coral tissues, suggesting SCSDVs might have a role in WP disease. Furthermore, Herpesviridae gene signatures dominated healthy tissues, corroborating reports that herpes-like viruses infect all corals. Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) sequences, similar to those recently identified in cultures of Symbiodinium (the algal symbionts of corals), were most common in bleached corals. This finding further implicates that these NCLDV viruses may have a role in bleaching, as suggested in previous studies. This study determined that a specific group of viruses is associated with diseased Caribbean corals and highlights the potential for viral disease in regional coral reef decline.",2013-08-15,"Soffer, Nitzan; Brandt, Marilyn E; Correa, Adrienne MS; Smith, Tyler B; Thurber, Rebecca Vega",The ISME Journal,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2639af832e7943cd094b97cd9803655df23605b1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3906806.xml.json,https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2013137.pdf,

It has also been demonstrated that multiple subsets of dendritic cells (DC), including DC-SIGN(+) cells, become significantly depleted in the blood and lymphoid tissues of AIDS patients, which may contribute to the failure in initiating effective host immune responses. The mechanism for DC depletion, however, is unclear. It is also known that vast quantities of viral envelope protein gp120 are shed from maturing HIV-1 virions and form circulating immune complexes in the serum of HIV-1-infected individuals, but the pathological role of gp120 in HIV-1 pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a previously unrecognized mechanism of DC death in chronic HIV-1 infection, in which ligation of DC-SIGN by gp120 sensitizes DC to undergo accelerated apoptosis in response to a variety of activation stimuli. The cultured monocyte-derived DC and also freshly-isolated DC-SIGN(+) blood DC that were exposed to either cross-linked recombinant gp120 or immune-complex gp120 in HIV(+) serum underwent considerable apoptosis after CD40 ligation or exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β. Furthermore, circulating DC-SIGN(+) DC that were isolated directly from HIV-1(+) individuals had actually been pre-sensitized by serum gp120 for activation-induced exorbitant apoptosis. In all cases the DC apoptosis was substantially inhibited by DC-SIGN blockade. Finally, we showed that accelerated DC apoptosis was a direct consequence of excessive activation of the pro-apoptotic molecule ASK-1 and transfection of siRNA against ASK-1 significantly prevented the activation-induced excessive DC death. Our study discloses a previously unknown mechanism of immune modulation by envelope protein gp120, provides new insights into HIV immunopathogenesis, and suggests potential therapeutic approaches to prevent DC depletion in chronic HIV infection.",2013-01-31,"Chen, Yongxiong; Hwang, Shiuh-Lin; Chan, Vera S.

The results were compared to pancreatic zymogen enzyme activities and histology in adult mice infected with the same virus. No effect of the reovirus type 3 on the adult mice could be elicited. In contrast, the suckling mice infected by the reovirus type 3 revealed a definite change in pancreatic zymogen enzymes. However, the zymogen enzymes were affected in a nonparallel fashion and three groups of enzymes with different responses were noted. Amylase and lipase activities were significantly diminished (P < 0.001) at 6 days of viral infection. The endopeptidases, trypsin (P < 0.025) and chymotrypsin (P < 0.001) activities were increased significantly in the infected group. The exopeptidases, carboxypeptidase A and B in the infected animals were not changed significantly compared to the control. It seems reasonable that the reovirus type 3 infection in the suckling mouse causes diminished lipase and amylase activities that might contribute to the pathogenesis of viral enteritis. Speculation: Studies on viral enteritis in infants and young animals have primarily implicated changes in the small intestine as the cause of diarrhea. The viral invasion of the intestinal mucosa causes villous cell destruction and as a consequence, the mucosa generated is immature and incapable of handling normal salt and water absorption. In addition, changes in pancreatic function as a result of an extension of the viral infection to the pancreatic parenchyma might contribute to the pathophysiologic mechanisms operating in viral enteritis. In the infected suckling mice, only amylase and lipase activities are diminished to a large extent, while trypsin and chymotrypsin activities are elevated and carboxypeptidase A and B activities remain unaffected. The nonparallel change in pancreatic enzymes toward a viral insult can be explained by a separate effect of the virus on the biosynthesis of each of the zymogen pancreatic enzymes. It is conceivable that amylase and lipase while in a developing stage, are more affected by the virus than the other pancreatic enzymes which are already developed to a certain extent. Another explanation is that lipase and amylase activities are intrinsically more prone to be decreased in response to different disease states affecting the pancreas. Diminished lipolytic and amylolytic activities due to viral gastroenteritis is a possible contributing factor of the diarrhea in infants and children.",1980,"Branski, David; Lebenthal, Emanuel; Faden, Howard S; Hatch, Terry F; Krasner, Joseph",Pediatr Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a3dc52f2158ddddb91e723dfbb7ce868103dd462.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086520/,

However, there is currently no approach that combines both sources of information in a single optimization problem. Here, we present a model that formally integrates both the energy-based and evolution-based approaches to predict the folding of multiple aligned RNA sequences. We have implemented an extended version of Pfold that identifies base pairs that have high probabilities of being conserved and of being energetically favorable. The consensus structure is predicted using a maximum expected accuracy scoring scheme to smoothen the effect of incorrectly predicted base pairs. Parameter tuning revealed that the probability of base pairing has a higher impact on the RNA structure prediction than the corresponding probability of being single stranded. Furthermore, we found that structurally conserved RNA motifs are mostly supported by folding energies. Other problems (e.g. RNA-folding kinetics) may also benefit from employing the principles of the model we introduce.

In this context, ciprofloxacin is part of the first-line of countermeasures against numerous high consequence bacteria. Significant resistance can occur via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and deletions within ciprofloxacin targeted genes. Ideally, use of ciprofloxacin would be prefaced with AR determination to avoid overuse or misuse of the antibiotic.

Sequencing results demonstrate MIPs capture and amplify targeted regions of interest at significant levels of coverage. Depending on the genetic variant, limits of detection (LOD) for high-throughput pooled sequencing ranged from approximately 300–1800 input genome copies. LODs increased 10-fold in the presence of contaminating human genome DNA. In addition, we show that MIPs can be used as an enrichment step with high resolution melt (HRM) real-time PCR which is a sensitive assay with a rapid time-to-answer.

This study aims to assess the efficacy of HA330 resin-directed hemoadsorption (HA) on endotoxin-induced porcine acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) model. METHODS: Twenty-four Chinese domestic pigs were allocated into saline group receiving intravenous infusion of saline (N = 6) and endotoxin group receiving intravenous infusion of LPS (N = 18). When ALI model was initially diagnosed, six pigs in the LPS and saline group were killed for BALF and histopathological analysis. The remaining 12 pigs in LPS group received 3-h HA (N = 6) or HA-sham (N = 6) treatment, respectively. Following another 5-h observation, animals were killed. Variables on hemodynamics, blood gases and lung mechanics were recorded at a series of time points. Differentially expressed cytokines and proteins were determined by ELISA and proteomics. RESULTS: HA treatment significantly improved injured oxygenation induced by LPS. HA also partially improved the barrier permeability and reduced lung edema and inflammation/injury induced by LPS infusion. Proteomic analysis showed the differentially expressed proteins between HA- and HA-sham-treated groups mostly belonged to the categories of acute inflammation/immune response, and proteolysis.

We used Pichia pastoris as expression system in common shake flasks and optimized expression in high density bench top fermentation. Specific binding of recombinant scFv was proven by flow cytometry. The recombinant scFv-SCR significantly enhanced CML of F-MuLV in vitro implying that FH binding to the viral surface was impaired by the scFv-SCR. This novel concept to enhance virolysis may provide a new approach for antiviral treatment.",2014-01-12,"Huber, Georg; Bánki, Zoltán; Kunert, Renate; Stoiber, Heribert",Biomed Res Int,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/52431fafe4d5ccd27011d899aa54aa5aa3537e95.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3913500.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3913500/,

The simplest way to understand the cross-presentation of peptides by different alleles is to classify these alleles into supertypes. A1 and A3 HLA supertypes are widely distributed in humans. However, direct structural and functional evidence for peptide presentation features of key alleles (e.g., HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03) are lacking. Herein, the molecular basis of peptide presentation of HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03 was demonstrated by crystal structure determination and thermostability measurements of complexes with T-cell epitopes from influenza virus (NP44), human immunodeficiency virus (RT313), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). When binding to the HIV peptide, RT313, the PΩ-Lys anchoring modes of HLA-A(*)30:01, and -A(*)30:03 were similar to those of HLA-A(*)11:01 in the A3 supertype. However, HLA-A(*)30:03, but not -A(*)30:01, also showed binding with the HLA(*)01:01-favored peptide, NP44, but with a specific structural conformation. Thus, different from our previous understanding, HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03 have specific peptide-binding characteristics that may lead to their distinct supertype-featured binding peptide motifs. Moreover, we also found that residue 77 in the F pocket was one of the key residues for the divergent peptide presentation characteristics of HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03. Interchanging residue 77 between HLA-A(*)30:01 and HLA-A(*)30:03 switched their presented peptide profiles. Our results provide important recommendations for screening virus and tumor-specific peptides among the population with prevalent HLA supertypes for vaccine development and immune interventions.",2019-07-23,"Zhu, Shiyan; Liu, Kefang; Chai, Yan; Wu, Yanan; Lu, Dan; Xiao, Wenling; Cheng, Hao; Zhao, Yingze; Ding, Chunming; Lyu, Jianxin; Lou, Yongliang; Gao, George F.; Liu, William J.",Front Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7a784ba89463c11f89c9a297dd0e980b2d27c5c5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6664060.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6664060/,

In this regard, currently two LRS platforms have demonstrated adequate performance: the Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and the nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Even though these techniques produce lower coverage and are more error prone than short-read sequencing, they continue to be more successful in identifying polycistronic RNAs, transcript isoforms including splice and transcript end variants, as well as transcript overlaps. Recent reports have successfully applied LRS for the investigation of the transcriptome of viruses belonging to various families. These studies have substantially increased the number of previously known viral RNA molecules. In this work, we used the Sequel and MinION technique from PacBio and ONT, respectively, to characterize the lytic transcriptome of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). In most samples, we analyzed the poly(A) fraction of the transcriptome, but we also performed random oligonucleotide-based sequencing. Besides cDNA sequencing, we also carried out native RNA sequencing. Our investigations identified more than 2,300 previously undetected transcripts, including coding, and non-coding RNAs, multi-splice transcripts, as well as polycistronic and complex transcripts. Furthermore, we found previously unsubstantiated transcriptional start sites, polyadenylation sites, and splice sites. A large number of novel transcriptional overlaps were also detected. Random-primed sequencing revealed that each convergent gene pair produces non-polyadenylated read-through RNAs overlapping the partner genes. Furthermore, we identified novel replication-associated transcripts overlapping the HSV-1 replication origins, and novel LAT variants with very long 5’ regions, which are co-terminal with the LAT-0.7kb transcript. Overall, our results demonstrated that the HSV-1 transcripts form an extremely complex pattern of overlaps, and that entire viral genome is transcriptionally active.

Deliberate infection, however, creates challenging questions, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) where HIS are new and ethical challenges may be heightened. Consultation with stakeholders is needed to support contextually appropriate and acceptable study design. We examined stakeholder perceptions about the acceptability and ethics of HIS in Malawi, to inform decisions about planned pneumococcal challenge research and wider understanding of HIS ethics in LMICs. METHODS: We conducted 6 deliberative focus groups and 15 follow-up interviews with research staff, medical students, and community representatives from rural and urban Blantyre. We also conducted 5 key informant interviews with clinicians, ethics committee members, and district health government officials. RESULTS: Stakeholders perceived HIS research to have potential population health benefits, but they also had concerns, particularly related to the safety of volunteers and negative community reactions. Acceptability depended on a range of conditions related to procedures for voluntary and informed consent, inclusion criteria, medical care or support, compensation, regulation, and robust community engagement. These conditions largely mirror those in existing guidelines for HIS and biomedical research in LMICs. Stakeholder perceptions pointed to potential tensions, for example, balancing equity, safety, and relevance in inclusion criteria.

In this study, we have evaluated the use of an anionic self-adjuvanting lipopeptide containing the TLR2 agonist Pam(2)Cys (E(8)Pam(2)Cys) to enhance the immunogenicity of VLPs containing the HCV structural proteins (core, E1 and E2) of genotype 1a. While co-formulation of this lipopeptide with VLPs only resulted in marginal improvements in dendritic cell (DC) uptake, its ability to concomitantly induce DC maturation at very small doses is a feature not observed using VLPs alone or in the presence of an aluminium hydroxide-based adjuvant (Alum). Dramatically improved VLP and E2-specific antibody responses were observed in VLP+E(8)Pam(2)Cys vaccinated mice where up to 3 doses of non-adjuvanted or traditionally alum-adjuvanted VLPs was required to match the antibody titres obtained with a single dose of VLPs formulated with this lipopeptide. This result also correlated with significantly higher numbers of specific antibody secreting cells that was detected in the spleens of VLP+E(8)Pam(2)Cys vaccinated mice and greater ability of sera from these mice to neutralise the binding and uptake of VLPs by Huh7 cells. Moreover, vaccination of HLA-A2 transgenic mice with this formulation also induced better VLP-specific IFN-γ-mediated responses compared to non-adjuvanted VLPs but comparable levels to that achieved when coadministered with complete freund’s adjuvant. These results suggest overall that the immunogenicity of HCV VLPs can be significantly improved by the addition of this novel adjuvant by targeting their delivery to DCs and could therefore constitute a viable vaccine strategy for the treatment of HCV.",2012-10-16,"Chua, Brendon Y.; Johnson, Douglas; Tan, Amabel; Earnest-Silveira, Linda; Sekiya, Toshiki; Chin, Ruth; Torresi, Joseph; Jackson, David C.",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/75396899537915606b74f2b600478ad066f9d594.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3472981.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3472981/,

However, the molecular and biological mechanisms of how Y. pseudotuberculosis evolved to such a remarkably virulent pathogen, Y. pestis, are not clear. The ability to initiate a rapid bacterial dissemination is a characteristic hallmark of Y. pestis infection. A distinguishing characteristic between the two Yersinia species is that Y. pseudotuberculosis strains possess an O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) while Y. pestis has lost the O-antigen during evolution and therefore exposes its core LPS. In this study, we showed that Y. pestis utilizes its core LPS to interact with SIGNR1 (CD209b), a C-type lectin receptor on antigen presenting cells (APCs), leading to bacterial dissemination to lymph nodes, spleen and liver, and the initiation of a systemic infection. We therefore propose that the loss of O-antigen represents a critical step in the evolution of Y. pseudotuberculosis into Y. pestis in terms of hijacking APCs, promoting bacterial dissemination and causing the plague.",2019-03-12,"Yang, Kun; He, Yingxia; Park, Chae Gyu; Kang, Young Sun; Zhang, Pei; Han, Yanping; Cui, Yujun; Bulgheresi, Silvia; Anisimov, Andrey P.; Dentovskaya, Svetlana V.; Ying, Xiaoling; Jiang, Lingyu; Ding, Honghui; Njiri, Olivia Adhiambo; Zhang, Shusheng; Zheng, Guoxing; Xia, Lianxu; Kan, Biao; Wang, Xin; Jing, Huaiqi; Yan, Meiying; Li, Wei; Wang, Yuanzhi; Xiamu, Xiding; Chen, Gang; Ma, Ding; Bartra, Sara Schesser; Plano, Gregory V.; Klena, John D.; Yang, Ruifu; Skurnik, Mikael; Chen, Tie",Front Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4d44adb48335ef12290b3584771b424aa28185e5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6422942.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6422942/,

The perception of its physiological function was restricted to sex determination and spermatogenesis. These views have been challenged in recent times with the identification of multiple ubiquitously expressed Y-chromosome genes and the discovery of several unexpected associations between the Y chromosome, immune system and complex polygenic traits. The collected evidence suggests that the Y chromosome influences immune and inflammatory responses in men, translating into genetically programmed susceptibility to diseases with a strong immune component. Phylogenetic studies reveal that carriers of a common European lineage of the Y chromosome (haplogroup I) possess increased risk of coronary artery disease. This occurs amidst upregulation of inflammation and suppression of adaptive immunity in this Y lineage, as well as inferior outcomes in human immunodeficiency virus infection. From structural analysis and experimental data, the UTY (Ubiquitously Transcribed Tetratricopeptide Repeat Containing, Y-Linked) gene is emerging as a promising candidate underlying the associations between Y-chromosome variants and the immunity-driven susceptibility to complex disease. This review synthesises the recent structural, experimental and clinical insights into the human Y chromosome in the context of men’s susceptibility to disease (with a particular emphasis on cardiovascular disease) and provides an overview of the paradigm shift in the perception of the Y chromosome.",2017-08-30,"Maan, Akhlaq A; Eales, James; Akbarov, Artur; Rowland, Joshua; Xu, Xiaoguang; Jobling, Mark A; Charchar, Fadi J; Tomaszewski, Maciej",Eur J Hum Genet,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e35ddb3ec39a3ee964c40b28e86e7960f265a26a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5643963.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5643963/,

However, fundamental questions regarding the ability of VLRPs to trigger DNA mutations and the mutation types it elicits remain elusive. Here, through plasmid transformation and β-galactosidase α-complementation analyses, we observed that visible light-responsive platinum-containing titania (TiO(2)) nanoparticle (NP)-mediated photocatalysis considerably reduces the number of Escherichia coli transformants. This suggests that such photocatalytic reactions cause DNA damage. DNA sequencing results demonstrated that the DNA damage comprises three mutation types, namely nucleotide insertion, deletion and substitution; this is the first study to report the types of mutations occurring after photocatalysis by TiO(2)-VLRPs.

In Nigeria, the existence of these subtypes in pigs has not been well studied. This study aimed at determining the prevalence and correlates of Influenza-A viruses circulating in piggery workers and pigs in Oke-aro and Goshen communities in Lagos, Nigeria. METHODS: Nasal swabs were taken from 197 consenting piggery workers and 281 randomly selected pigs to determine the prevalence of Influenza-A (H1, H3, H5) using Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction test (gene M). An interviewer administered questionnaire was used to collect information on demography, Influenza-A related symptoms experienced, personal hygiene and management practices from the piggery workers. Descriptive statistics was used and chi square test performed at 5% significant level. RESULTS: All piggery workers and pigs’ nasal swabs tested negative for Influenza-A viruses, hence, association could not be tested. Mean age of piggery workers was 41 ± 13.6 years and 60% were females. Forty two percent were farm attendants, 38.0% were pig farmers and the rest butchers. Nineteen percent had history of headache; 14.0% had catarrh and cough; 4.0% had sore-throat; 5.0% had diarrhea; while 48.0% had muscle pain at the time of data collection. The mean body temperature for the pig workers was 36.5 ± 0.5 °C. A significant difference (p<0.05) existed among piggery workers who had muscle pains.

Here, we show that both the soluble factors and small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are capable of transmitting paracrine senescence to nearby cells. Analysis of individual cells internalizing sEVs, using a Cre-reporter system, show a positive correlation between sEV uptake and senescence activation. We find an increase in the number of multivesicular bodies during senescence in vivo. sEV protein characterization by mass spectrometry (MS) followed by a functional siRNA screen identify interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) as being partially responsible for transmitting senescence to normal cells.

METHODS: RAW264.7 cells (a murine macrophage-like cell line) were cultured in the absence or in the presence of PTS2 (3–10 μM) together with or without IFN-γ (10 ng/ml). IP-10/CXCL10 expression was measured by specific enzyme-amplified immunoassays and reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). Phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 were detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: We found that PTS2 inhibited IFN-γ-induced up-regulation of IP-10/CXCL10 protein level in a dose- and time-dependent manner in RAW264.7 cells. RT-PCR experiments showed that PTS2 suppressed IFN-γ-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression at mRNA levels. Mechanistically, PTS2 prevented phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1, but did not interfere with the p38 pathway. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of PTS2 on IP-10/CXCL10 up-regulation was slightly stronger than JAK2 inhibitor AG490. CONCLUSION: PTS2 inhibits IFN-γ-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression in RAW264.7 cells by targeting the JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway, suggesting that PTS2 could exert anti-inflammatory effects through attenuating the formation of chemokine IP-10/CXCL10.",2010-04-07,"Han, Cui; Fu, Jin; Liu, Ziwen; Huang, Huang; Luo, Lan; Yin, Zhimin",Inflamm Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/92fca8573cfef7235acba06143c97dbf8ad6f034.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079753.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079753/,

Early diagnosis of DF helps to diminish its burden on public health. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase amplification assays (RT-PCR) are the standard method for molecular detection of the dengue virus (DENV). Real-time RT-PCR analysis is not suitable for on-site screening since mobile devices are large, expensive, and complex. In this study, two RT-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assays were developed to detect DENV1-4. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using two quantitative RNA molecular standards, the analytical sensitivity of a RT-RPA targeting the 3´non-translated region of DENV1-4 was found to range from 14 (DENV4) to 241 (DENV1-3) RNA molecules detected. The assay was specific and did not cross detect other Flaviviruses. The RT-RPA assay was tested in a mobile laboratory combining magnetic-bead based total nucleic acid extraction and a portable detection device in Kedougou (Senegal) and in Bangkok (Thailand). In Kedougou, the RT-RPA was operated at an ambient temperature of 38°C with auxiliary electricity tapped from a motor vehicle and yielded a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 98% (n=31) and 100% (n=23), respectively. While in the field trial in Bangkok, the clinical sensitivity and specificity were 72% (n=90) and 100%(n=41), respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: During the first 5 days of infection, the developed DENV1-4 RT-RPA assays constitute a suitable accurate and rapid assay for DENV diagnosis.

In addition to its physiological role in heme degradation, HO-1 may influence a number of cellular processes, including growth, inflammation, and apoptosis. By virtue of anti-inflammatory effects, HO-1 limits tissue damage in response to proinflammatory stimuli and prevents allograft rejection after transplantation. The transcriptional upregulation of HO-1 responds to many agents, such as hypoxia, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. HO-1 and its constitutively expressed isozyme, heme oxygenase-2, catalyze the rate-limiting step in the conversion of heme to its metabolites, bilirubin IXα, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). The mechanisms by which HO-1 provides protection most likely involve its enzymatic reaction products. Remarkably, administration of CO at low concentrations can substitute for HO-1 with respect to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, suggesting a role for CO as a key mediator of HO-1 function.

Mounting data show that substantial critical illness-induced changes in the immune system can be observed in most ICU patients and that not only “hyper-inflammation” but also persistence of an anti-inflammatory phenotype (as in sepsis-associated immunosuppression) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Despite common perception, changes in functional immunity cannot be adequately assessed by routine inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, or numerical analysis of leukocyte (sub)-counts. Cytokines appear also not suited due to their short half-life and pleiotropy, their unexclusive origin from immune cells, and their potential to undergo antagonization by circulating inactivating molecules. Thus, beyond leukocyte quantification and use of routine biomarkers, direct assessment of immune cell function seems required to characterize the immune systems’ status. This may include determination of, e.g., ex vivo cellular cytokine release, phagocytosis activity, and/or antigen-presenting capacity. In this regard, standardized flow-cytometric assessment of the major histocompatibility-II complex human leukocyte antigen (-D related) (HLA-DR) has gained particular interest. Monocytic HLA-DR (mHLA-DR) controls the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity and may serve as a “global” biomarker of injury-associated immunosuppression, and its decreased expression is associated with adverse clinical outcomes (e.g., secondary infection risk, mortality). Importantly, recent data demonstrate that injury-associated immunosuppression can be reversed—opening up new therapeutic avenues in affected patients.

All of the patient’s physical complaints had been investigated separately during her previous medical examinations, and several tests repeatedly gave negative results. The patient received different diagnoses that describe only part of her problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome for visceral pain, fibromyalgia for arthralgias or depression for fatigue. These approaches gave rise to pharmacological or physical treatments which did not improve her quality of life in any way and in some instances worsened the situation. Pronounced joint hypermobility which led the patient to flex her joints excessively, causing subluxations in several districts, was the only sign overlooked.

In order to determine the most reliable bioinformatics tools to assess the likely pathogenicity of PITX2 variants, the results of bioinformatics predictions were compared to the impact of variants on PITX2 structure and function. The MutPred, Provean, and PMUT bioinformatic tools were found to have the highest performance in predicting the pathogenicity effects of all 18 characterized missense variants in PITX2, all with sensitivity and specificity >93%. Applying these three programs to assess the likely pathogenicity of 13 previously uncharacterized PITX2 missense variants predicted 12/13 variants as deleterious, except A30V which was predicted as benign variant for all programs.

Here, we characterized this process relative to (1) specific 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA cleavage sites and (2) identity of specific upstream signaling elements in this pathway. Capillary electrophoresis indicated that DON at concentrations as low as 200 ng/ml evoked selective rRNA cleavage after 6 h and that 1000 ng/ml caused cleavage within 2 h. Northern blot analysis revealed that DON exposure induced six rRNA cleavage fragments from 28S rRNA and five fragments from 18S rRNA. When selective kinase inhibitors were used to identify potential upstream signals, RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck), and p38 were found to be required for rRNA cleavage, whereas c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase were not. Furthermore, rRNA fragmentation was suppressed by the p53 inhibitors pifithrin-α and pifithrin-μ as well as the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Concurrent apoptosis was confirmed by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and flow cytometry. DON activated caspases 3, 8, and 9, thus suggesting the possible coinvolvement of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in rRNA cleavage. Satratoxin G (SG), anisomycin, and ricin also induced specific rRNA cleavage profiles identical to those of DON, suggesting that ribotoxins might share a conserved rRNA cleavage mechanism. Taken together, DON-induced rRNA cleavage is likely to be closely linked to apoptosis activation and appears to involve the sequential activation of PKR/Hck →p38→p53→caspase 8/9→caspase 3.",2012-04-05,"He, Kaiyu; Zhou, Hui-Ren; Pestka, James J.",Toxicological Sciences,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e780acee813f0a8ed30ad3e2db8b957201c78a8b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3355321.xml.json,https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article-pdf/127/2/382/16684710/kfs134.pdf,

In the present study, an RNA agonist of RIG-I was synthesized in vitro and shown to stimulate RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses at concentrations in the picomolar range. In human lung epithelial A549 cells, 5′pppRNA specifically stimulated multiple parameters of the innate antiviral response, including IRF3, IRF7 and STAT1 activation, and induction of inflammatory and interferon stimulated genes - hallmarks of a fully functional antiviral response. Evaluation of the magnitude and duration of gene expression by transcriptional profiling identified a robust, sustained and diversified antiviral and inflammatory response characterized by enhanced pathogen recognition and interferon (IFN) signaling. Bioinformatics analysis further identified a transcriptional signature uniquely induced by 5′pppRNA, and not by IFNα-2b, that included a constellation of IRF7 and NF-kB target genes capable of mobilizing multiple arms of the innate and adaptive immune response. Treatment of primary PBMCs or lung epithelial A549 cells with 5′pppRNA provided significant protection against a spectrum of RNA and DNA viruses. In C57Bl/6 mice, intravenous administration of 5′pppRNA protected animals from a lethal challenge with H1N1 Influenza, reduced virus titers in mouse lungs and protected animals from virus-induced pneumonia. Strikingly, the RIG-I-specific transcriptional response afforded partial protection from influenza challenge, even in the absence of type I interferon signaling. This systems approach provides transcriptional, biochemical, and in vivo analysis of the antiviral efficacy of 5′pppRNA and highlights the therapeutic potential associated with the use of RIG-I agonists as broad spectrum antiviral agents.",2013-04-25,"Goulet, Marie-Line; Olagnier, David; Xu, Zhengyun; Paz, Suzanne; Belgnaoui, S.

We implemented a study of the feasibility and efficacy of face masks and hand hygiene to reduce influenza transmission among Hong Kong household members. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of households (composed of at least 3 members) where an index subject presented with influenza-like-illness of <48 hours duration. After influenza was confirmed in an index case by the QuickVue Influenza A+B rapid test, the household of the index subject was randomized to 1) control or 2) surgical face masks or 3) hand hygiene. Households were visited within 36 hours, and 3, 6 and 9 days later. Nose and throat swabs were collected from index subjects and all household contacts at each home visit and tested by viral culture. The primary outcome measure was laboratory culture confirmed influenza in a household contact; the secondary outcome was clinically diagnosed influenza (by self-reported symptoms). We randomized 198 households and completed follow up home visits in 128; the index cases in 122 of those households had laboratory-confirmed influenza. There were 21 household contacts with laboratory confirmed influenza corresponding to a secondary attack ratio of 6%. Clinical secondary attack ratios varied from 5% to 18% depending on case definitions. The laboratory-based or clinical secondary attack ratios did not significantly differ across the intervention arms. Adherence to interventions was variable. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The secondary attack ratios were lower than anticipated, and lower than reported in other countries, perhaps due to differing patterns of susceptibility, lack of significant antigenic drift in circulating influenza virus strains recently, and/or issues related to the symptomatic recruitment design.

We therefore set out to quantify, in a population-based adult general population cohort, the possible protection against acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) conferred by a person’s self-perceived hand-washing frequency. METHODS: During the pandemic influenza season from September 2009 through May 2010, a cohort of 4365 adult residents of Stockholm County, Sweden, reported respiratory illnesses in real-time. A questionnaire about typical contact and hand-washing behaviour was administered at the end of the period (response rate 70%). RESULTS: There was no significant decrease in ARI rates among adults with increased daily hand-washing frequency: Compared to 2–4 times/day, 5–9 times was associated with an adjusted ARI rate ratio (RR) of 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-1.33), 10–19 times with RR = 1.22 (CI 0.97-1.53), and ≥20 times with RR = 1.03 (CI 0.81-1.32). A similar lack of effect was seen for influenza-like illness, and in all investigated subgroups. We found no clear effect modification by contact behaviour. Health care workers exhibited rate ratio point estimates below unity, but no dose-risk trend. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increases in what adult laymen perceive as being adequate hand-washing may not significantly reduce the risk of ARIs. This might have implications for the design of public health campaigns in the face of threatening outbreaks of respiratory infections. However, the generalizability of our results to non-pandemic circumstances should be further explored.

In the central nervous system (CNS), CCL5 and its receptors have multiple functions, including promoting neuroinflammation, insulin signaling, neuromodulator of synaptic activity and neuroprotection against a variety of neurotoxins. Evidence has also suggested that this chemokine may regulate opioid response. The multifunctional profile of CCL5 might correlate with its ability to bind different chemokine receptors, as well as with its unique cellular expression. In this work, we have used fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry to examine the expression profile of CCL5 mRNA in the adult rat brain and provide evidence of its cellular localization. We have observed that the highest expression of CCL5 mRNA occurs in all major fiber tracts, including the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and cerebral peduncle. In these tracts, CCL5 mRNA was localized in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Astrocytic and microglial expression was also evident in several brain areas including the cerebral cortex, caudate/putamen, hippocampus, and thalamus. Furthermore, using a specific neuronal marker, we observed CCL5 mRNA expression in discrete layers of the cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, in the midbrain, CCL5 mRNA co-localized with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells of the ventral tegmental area, suggesting that CCL5 might be expressed by a subset of dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic system. The expression of CCL5 mRNA and protein, together with its receptors, in selected brain cell populations proposes that this chemokine could be involved in neuronal/glial communication.",2018-01-12,"Lanfranco, Maria Fe; Mocchetti, Italo; Burns, Mark P.; Villapol, Sonia",Front Neuroanat,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/fe4829233859c2471b9aa99a1027a1fab44b153c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5770405.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5770405/,

To accurately understand and explain epidemic behaviour information on contact networks is required, but only limited empirical data is available. Online respondent-driven detection can provide relevant epidemiological data on numbers of contact persons and dynamics of contacts between pairs of individuals. We aimed to analyse contact networks with respect to sociodemographic and geographical characteristics, vaccine-induced immunity and self-reported symptoms. METHODS: In 2014, volunteers from two large participatory surveillance panels in the Netherlands and Belgium were invited for a survey. Participants were asked to record numbers of contacts at different locations and self-reported influenza-like-illness symptoms, and to invite 4 individuals they had met face to face in the preceding 2 weeks. We calculated correlations between linked individuals to investigate mixing patterns. RESULTS: In total 1560 individuals completed the survey who reported in total 30591 contact persons; 488 recruiter-recruit pairs were analysed. Recruitment was assortative by age, education, household size, influenza vaccination status and sentiments, indicating that participants tended to recruit contact persons similar to themselves. We also found assortative recruitment by symptoms, reaffirming our objective of sampling contact persons whom a participant may infect or by whom a participant may get infected in case of an outbreak. Recruitment was random by sex and numbers of contact persons. Relationships between pairs were influenced by the spatial distribution of peer recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: Although complex mechanisms influence online peer recruitment, the observed statistical relationships reflected the observed contact network patterns in the general population relevant for the transmission of respiratory pathogens.

Villous immaturity was the main histological finding in the placental tissues, although placentas without alterations were also frequently observed. Significant enhancement of the number of syncytial sprouts was observed in the placentas of women infected during the third trimester, indicating the development of placental abnormalities after ZIKV infection. Hyperplasia of Hofbauer cells (HCs) was also observed in these third-trimester placental tissues, and remarkably, HCs were the only ZIKV-positive fetal cells found in the placentas studied that persisted until birth, as revealed by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Thirty-three percent of women infected during pregnancy delivered infants with congenital abnormalities, although no pattern correlating the gestational stage at infection, the IHC positivity of HCs in placental tissues and the presence of congenital malformations at birth was observed.

However, several studies are beginning to reveal layers of restriction to oncolytic virotherapy that are present before an adaptive neutralizing immune response. Some of these barriers are present constitutively halting infection before it even begins, whereas others are raised by minute cues triggered by virus infection. Indeed, we and others have noticed that delivering viruses to tumors may not be the biggest obstacle to successful therapy, but instead the physical make-up of the tumor and its capacity to mount antiviral defenses seem to be the most important efficacy determinants.

Bed occupancy rates often surpass the good hospital bed management threshold of 85%, which can result in poor conditions in the workplace. This study explores how QoC-scores could be improved by investing in additional beds and/or better vaccination programs against vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. METHODS: The Cobb–Douglas model was selected to define the improvement in QoC (%) as a function of two strategies (rotavirus vaccination coverage [%] and addition of extra hospital beds [% of existing beds]), allowing improvement-isocurves to be produced. Subsequently, budget minimization was applied to determine the combination of the two strategies needed to reach a given QoC improvement at the lowest cost. Data from Jessa Hospital (Hasselt, Belgium) were chosen as an example. The annual population in the catchment area to be vaccinated was 7000 children; the winter period was 90 days with 34 pediatric beds available. Rotavirus vaccination cost per course was €118.26 and the daily cost of a pediatric bed was €436.53. The target QoC increase was fixed at 50%. The model was first built with baseline parameter values. RESULTS: The model predicted that a combination of 64% vaccine coverage and 39% extra hospital beds (≈ 13 extra beds) in winter would improve QoC-scores by 50% for the minimum budget allocation.

We call this the L11 ‘P-site loop’. Chemical protection of wild-type ribosome shows that that the P-site loop is inherently flexible, i.e. it is extended into the ribosomal P-site when this is unoccupied by tRNA, while it is retracted into the terminal loop of 25S rRNA Helix 84 when the P-site is occupied. To further analyze the function of this structure, a series of mutants within the P-site loop were created and analyzed. A mutant that favors interaction of the P-site loop with the terminal loop of Helix 84 promoted increased affinity for peptidyl-tRNA, while another that favors its extension into the ribosomal P-site had the opposite effect. The two mutants also had opposing effects on binding of aa-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site, and downstream functional effects were observed on translational fidelity, drug resistance/hypersensitivity, virus maintenance and overall cell growth.

Clinical signs were not correlated with being qPCR‐positive for EHV‐4, EHV‐2, or EHV‐5. None of the samples were qPCR‐positive for EIV, ERAV, ERBV, and S. equi. The qPCR assay failed quality control for RNA viruses in 25% (46/167) of samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Clinical signs of respiratory disease were poorly correlated with qPCR positive status for EHV‐2, −4, and −5. The importance of γ‐herpesviruses (EHV‐2 and 5) in respiratory disease is poorly understood. Equine herpesvirus type‐1 or 4 (EHV‐1 or EHV‐4) were detected in 4.2% of horses, which could have serious consequences if shedding animals entered a population of susceptible horses. Biosecurity measures are important when introducing recently imported horses into resident US populations of horses.",2018-05-15,"Smith, Fauna Leah; Watson, Johanna L.; Spier, Sharon J.; Kilcoyne, Isabelle; Mapes, Samantha; Sonder, Claudia; Pusterla, Nicola",J Vet Intern Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d2652d3fd2fc1f01fabe7b5fff12aa99c377aae4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6060314.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6060314/,

To clarify the evolution of both VP1 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) regions of GII.P17-GII.17, we analyzed both global and novel Japanese strains detected during 2013–2017. Time-scaled phylogenetic trees revealed that the ancestral GII.17 VP1 region diverged around 1949, while the ancestral GII.P17 RdRp region diverged around 2010. The evolutionary rates of the VP1 and RdRp regions were estimated at ~2.7 × 10(−3) and ~2.3 × 10(−3) substitutions/site/year, respectively. The phylogenetic distances of the VP1 region exhibited no overlaps between intra-cluster and inter-cluster peaks in the GII.17 strains, whereas those of the RdRp region exhibited a unimodal distribution in the GII.P17 strains. Conformational epitope positions in the VP1 protein of the GII.P17-GII.17 strains were similar, although some substitutions, insertions and deletions had occurred. Strains belonging to the same cluster also harbored substitutions around the binding sites for the histo-blood group antigens of the VP1 protein. Moreover, some amino acid substitutions were estimated to be near the interface between monomers and the active site of the RdRp protein.

Using a mechanism-based kinetic trapping technique to identify disulfide exchange interactions on the intact surface of living lymphocytes, we found that Trx1 catalytically interacts with a single principal target protein. This target protein was identified as the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 8 (TNFRSF8/CD30). We demonstrate that the redox interaction is highly specific for both Trx1 and CD30 and that the redox state of CD30 determines its ability to engage the cognate ligand and transduce signals.

This prospective study aimed to determine antibiotic misuse in children and adults with RTI, using an expert panel reference standard, in order to prioritise the target age population for antibiotic stewardship interventions. We recruited children and adults who presented at the emergency department or were hospitalised with clinical presentation of RTI in The Netherlands and Israel. A panel of three experienced physicians adjudicated a reference standard diagnosis (i.e. bacterial or viral infection) for all the patients using all available clinical and laboratory information, including a 28-day follow-up assessment. The cohort included 284 children and 232 adults with RTI (median age, 1.3 years and 64.5 years, respectively).

We found that pulmonary Nogo-B was significantly repressed after LPS instillation in C57BL/6 mice. Over-expression of pulmonary Nogo-B using an adenovirus vector carrying the Nogo-B-RFP-3flag gene (Ad-Nogo-B) significantly prolonged the survival of mice challenged with a lethal dose of LPS. The Ad-Nogo-B-treated mice also had less severe lung injury, less alveolar protein exudation, and a higher number of macrophages but less neutrophil infiltration compared with Ad-RFP-treated mice.

Nipah virus (NiV) is an important threat owing to its broad host and geographical range, high case fatality, potential for human-to-human transmission and lack of effective prevention or therapies. Here, we investigate the origin of the first identified outbreak of NiV encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore. We analyse data on livestock production from the index site (a commercial pig farm in Malaysia) prior to and during the outbreak, on Malaysian agricultural production, and from surveys of NiV's wildlife reservoir (flying foxes). Our analyses suggest that repeated introduction of NiV from wildlife changed infection dynamics in pigs. Initial viral introduction produced an explosive epizootic that drove itself to extinction but primed the population for enzootic persistence upon reintroduction of the virus. The resultant within-farm persistence permitted regional spread and increased the number of human infections. This study refutes an earlier hypothesis that anomalous El Niño Southern Oscillation-related climatic conditions drove emergence and suggests that priming for persistence drove the emergence of a novel zoonotic pathogen.

We modeled the number of mechanical ventilators that could be used in addition to the number of hospital-based ventilators currently in use. METHODS: We identified key components of the health care system needed to deliver ventilation therapy, quantified the maximum number of additional ventilators that each key component could support at various capacity levels (ie, conventional, contingency, and crisis), and determined the constraining key component at each capacity level. RESULTS: Our study results showed that US hospitals could absorb between 26,200 and 56,300 additional ventilators at the peak of a national influenza pandemic outbreak with robust pre-pandemic planning. CONCLUSIONS: The current US health care system may have limited capacity to use additional mechanical ventilators during a large-scale public health emergency. Emergency planners need to understand their health care systems’ capability to absorb additional resources and expand care. This methodology could be adapted by emergency planners to determine stockpiling goals for critical resources or to identify alternatives to manage overwhelming critical care need.

METHODS: After the formation of a VCR-oleic acid ion-pair complex (VCR-OA), the VCR-OA-loaded submicron emulsion (VCR-OA-SME), prepared by classical high-pressure homogenization, was characterized and its in vitro anticancer effects were evaluated. RESULTS: The submicron-emulsion formulation exhibited a homogeneous round shape. The mean particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency were 157.6 ± 12.6 nm, −26.5 ± 5.0 mV and 78.64% ± 3.44%, respectively. An in vitro release study of the VCR-OA-SME revealed that 12.4% of the VCR was released within the first 2 hours (initial burst-release phase) and the rest of the drug was detected in the subsequent sustained-release phase. Compared with VCR solution, the pharmacokinetic study of VCR-OA-SME showed relatively longer mean residence time (mean residence time [0–∞] increased from 187.19 to 227.56 minutes), higher maximum concentration (from 252.13 ng/mL to 533.34 ng/mL), and greater area under the curve (area under the curve [0–∞] from 11,417.77 μg/L/minute to 17,164.34 μg/L/minute. Moreover, the VCR-OA-SME exhibited higher cytotoxicity (P < 0.05) on tumor cells by inducing cell arrest in the G2/M phase or even apoptosis (P < 0.05).

MEDI-565 binds CEA on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells to induce T-cell mediated killing of cancer cells. To understand the molecular basis of human CEA recognition by MEDI-565 and how polymorphisms and spliced forms of CEA may affect MEDI-565 activity, we mapped the epitope of MEDI-565 on CEA using mutagenesis and homology modeling approaches. We found that MEDI-565 recognized a conformational epitope in the A2 domain comprised of amino acids 326–349 and 388–410, with critical residues F(326), T(328), N(333), V(388), G(389), P(390), E(392), I(408), and N(410). Two non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10407503, rs7249230) were identified in the epitope region, but they are found at low homozygosity rates. Searching the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank® database, we further identified a single, previously uncharacterized mRNA splice variant of CEA that lacks a portion of the N-terminal domain, the A1 and B1 domains, and a large portion of the A2 domain. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of multiple cancers showed widespread expression of full-length CEA in these tumors, with less frequent but concordant expression of the CEA splice variant. Because the epitope was largely absent from the CEA splice variant, MEDI-565 did not bind or mediate T-cell killing of cells solely expressing this form of CEA. In addition, the splice variant did not interfere with MEDI-565 binding or activity when co-expressed with full-length CEA. Thus MEDI-565 may broadly target CEA-positive tumors without regard for expression of the short splice variant of CEA. Together our data suggest that MEDI-565 activity will neither be impacted by SNPs nor by a splice variant of CEA.",2012-05-04,"Peng, Li; Oberst, Michael D.; Huang, Jiaqi; Brohawn, Philip; Morehouse, Chris; Lekstrom, Kristen; Baeuerle, Patrick A.; Wu, Herren; Yao, Yihong; Coats, Steven R.; Dall’Acqua, William; Damschroder, Melissa; Hammond, Scott A.",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d5a2557d0cb42ffcb93f693d7fa4e70fb817e20b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3344869.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3344869/,

DPP-4 inhibitors can induce autophagy in a GLP-1–dependent manner, but other diverse effects could be relevant.

The availability of a rapid NAAT with applicability for resource-limited or point-of-care (POC) settings would fill a great need in HIV diagnostics, allowing for timely diagnosis or confirmation of infection status, as well as facilitating the diagnosis of acute infection, screening and evaluation of infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Isothermal amplification methods, such as reverse-transcription, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), exhibit characteristics that are ideal for POC settings, since they are typically quicker, easier to perform, and allow for integration into low-tech, portable heating devices. METHODOLOGY/SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: In this study, we evaluated the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay using portable, non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heating devices that generate heat from the exothermic reaction of calcium oxide and water. The NINA heating devices exhibited stable temperatures throughout the amplification reaction and consistent amplification results between three separate devices and a thermalcycler. The performance of the NINA heaters was validated using whole blood specimens from HIV-1 infected patients.

In western Switzerland, an increase of severe cases of S. pyogenes invasive infections was observed between December 2015 and March 2016. Our aim was (i) to investigate these cases by the use of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and (ii) to determine the specific virulome and resistome of each isolate in order to undertake adequate public health measures. Eleven Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from 11 patients with severe invasive infections between December 13, 2015 and March 12, 2016 were included in our study. Practically, emm-typing, MLST and WGS were used to investigate the relatedness between the isolates. The presence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes as well as mutations in transcriptional regulators of virulence and in genes encoding for antibiotic targets were assessed. Three and two groups of isolates shared the same emm-type and ST type, respectively. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed 14 to 32 SNPs between the strains of the same emm-type group, ruling out the possibility of a clonal outbreak. Mutations found in covS and rocA could partially explain an increased virulence. As these reassuring results were obtained in less than 10 days, no specific hospital hygiene and no dedicated public health measures had to be undertaken. WGS is a powerful technique to discriminate between closely related strains, excluding an outbreak in less than 10 days. Moreover, WGS provided extensive data on the virulome and resistome of all these strains.

Patients’ samples were screened by real-time RT-PCR and influenza viruses isolated were characterized antigenically by haemagglutination inhibition assay and genetically by sequencing of HA and NA genes. RESULTS: 32% (397/1248) of ILI and 29% (581/1997) of SARI patients tested were positive for influenza viruses. In 2014–2015 the median week of influenza detection was week 7/2015 with B/Yamagata lineage viruses dominating (79%); in 2015–2016—week 5/2016 was the median with A/H1N1pdm09 viruses prevailing (83%); and in 2016–2017 a bimodal distribution of influenza activity was observed—the first wave was caused by A/H3N2 (55%) with median week 51/2016 and the second by B/Victoria lineage viruses (45%) with median week 9/2017.

In such cases, it can be challenging to maintain adequate gas exchange by conventional mechanical ventilation and at the same time prevent further ventilator-induced lung injury. We report a young HIV positive male with poorly compliant lungs and pneumomediastinum secondary to severe Pneumocystis infection, rescued with veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO). CASE PRESENTATION: A 26 year old male with no significant past medical history was admitted with fever, cough and shortness of breath. He initially required non-invasive ventilation for respiratory failure. However, his respiratory function progressively deteriorated due to increasing pulmonary infiltrates and development of pneumomediastinum, eventually requiring endotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation. Despite attempts at optimizing gas exchange by ventilatory maneuvers, patients’ pulmonary parameters worsened necessitating rescue ECMO therapy. The introduction of V-V ECMO facilitated the use of ultra-protective lung ventilation and prevented progression of pneumomediastinum, maintaining optimal gas exchange. It allowed time for the antibiotics to show effect and pulmonary parenchyma to heal. Further diagnostic workup revealed Pneumocystis jirovecii as the causative organism for pneumonia and serology confirmed Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. Patient was successfully treated with appropriate antimicrobials and de-cannulated after six days of ECMO support.

With the discovery of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protective axis of RAS namely ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas that counteracts the deleterious ACE/AngII/AT1R axis has been established. This axis is emerging as a novel target to attenuate ocular inflammation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the hypothesis that enhancing the activity of the protective axis of RAS by subretinal delivery of an AAV8 (Y733F)-ACE2 vector would protect against the ocular inflammation in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) mice through regulating the local immune responses. Our studies demonstrated that increased ACE2 expression exerts protective effects on inflammation in EAU mouse by modulating ocular immune responses, including the differentiation of Th1/Th17 cells and the polarization of M1/M2 macrophages; whereas the systemic immune responses appeared not affected. These effects were mediated by activating the Ang-(1–7)/Mas and inhibiting the MAPK, NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways.

We examined the background, current situation, challenges, and perspectives of global sanitation. We used bibliometric analysis and word cluster analysis to evaluate sanitation research from 1992 to 2016 based on the Science Citation Index EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) databases. Our results show that sanitation is a comprehensive field connected with multiple categories, and the increasing number of publications reflects a strong interest in this research area. Most of the research took place in developed countries, especially the USA, although sanitation problems are more serious in developing countries. Innovations in sanitation techniques may keep susceptible populations from contracting diseases caused by various kinds of contaminants and microorganisms. Hence, the hygienization of human excreta, resource recovery, and removal of micro-pollutants from excreta can serve as effective sustainable solutions. Commercialized technologies, like composting, anaerobic digestion, and storage, are reliable but still face challenges in addressing the links between the political, social, institutional, cultural, and educational aspects of sanitation. Innovative technologies, such as Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs), Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs), and struvite precipitation, are at the TRL (Technology readiness levels) 8 level, meaning that they qualify as “actual systems completed and qualified through test and demonstration.” Solutions that take into consideration economic feasibility and all the different aspects of sanitation are required.

Four influenza virus types have been identified to date: A, B, C and D, with only A–C known to infect humans. Influenza A and B viruses are responsible for seasonal influenza epidemics in humans and are responsible for up to a billion flu infections annually. The M2 protein is present in all influenza types and belongs to the class of viroporins, i.e., small proteins that form ion channels that increase membrane permeability in virus-infected cells. In influenza A and B, AM2 and BM2 are predominantly proton channels, although they also show some permeability to monovalent cations. By contrast, M2 proteins in influenza C and D, CM2 and DM2, appear to be especially selective for chloride ions, with possibly some permeability to protons. These differences point to different biological roles for M2 in types A and B versus C and D, which is also reflected in their sequences. AM2 is by far the best characterized viroporin, where mechanistic details and rationale of its acid activation, proton selectivity, unidirectionality, and relative low conductance are beginning to be understood.

To classify severity, the A-DROP scale proposed by the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS), the CURB-65 score of the British Respiratory Society (BTS) and the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) are widely used in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Japan. To evaluate how correctly these conventional prognostic guidelines for CAP reflect the severity of non-HIV PCP, we retrospectively analyzed 21 patients with non-HIV PCP. METHODS: A total of 21 patients were diagnosed by conventional staining and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory samples with chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) findings. We compared the severity of 21 patients with PCP classified by A-DROP, CURB-65, and PSI. Also, patients’ characteristics, clinical pictures, laboratory results at first visit or admission and intervals from diagnosis to start of specific-PCP therapy were evaluated in both survivor and non-survivor groups. RESULTS: Based on A-DROP, 18 patients were classified as mild or moderate; respiratory failure developed in 15 of these 18 (83.3%), and 7/15 (46.7%) died. Based on CURB-65, 19 patients were classified as mild or moderate; respiratory failure developed in 16/19 (84.2%), and 8 of the 16 (50%) died. In contrast, PSI classified 14 as severe or extremely severe; all of the 14 (100%) developed respiratory failure and 8/14 (57.1%) died. There were no significant differences in laboratory results in these groups. The time between the initial visit and diagnosis, and the time between the initial visit and starting of specific-PCP therapy were statistically shorter in the survivor group than in the non-survivor group.

They are often receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics; they have multiple entry points for pathogens; and their immune system is impaired by blood circuit interaction. These factors are thought to predispose them to fungal infections. We thus aimed to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors, and prognosis of fungal infections in adults on ECMO. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry, which compiles data on ECMO use from hundreds of international centers. We included all adult patients from 2006 to 2016 on any mode of ECMO with either a diagnosis of fungal infection or a positive fungal culture. RESULTS: Our study comprised 2129 adult patients (10.8%) with fungal colonization or infection. Aspergillus involvement (colonization or infection) was present in 272 patients (1.4%), of whom 35.7% survived to hospital discharge. There were 245 patients (1.2%) with Candida invasive bloodstream infection, with 35.9% survival. Risk factors for Aspergillus involvement included solid organ transplant (OR 1.83; p = 0.008), respiratory support (OR 2.75; p < 0.001), and influenza infection (OR 2.48; p < 0.001). Risk factors for candidemia included sepsis (OR 1.60; p = 0.005) and renal replacement therapy (OR 1.55; p = 0.007). In multivariable analysis, Aspergillus involvement (OR 0.40; p < 0.001) and candidemia (OR 0.47; p < 0.001) were both independently associated with decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Aspergillus involvement and Candida invasive bloodstream infection were not higher in patients on ECMO than what has been reported in the general intensive care population. Both were independently associated with a reduced survival. Aspergillus involvement was strongly associated with ECMO for respiratory support and influenza.

A total of 946 children participated in this study. Plasma was subjected to high-throughput proteomic profiling. Statistical pattern-recognition methods were used to find proteome-patterns that defined disease groups. Plasma proteome-patterns accurately distinguished children with CM and with SMA from those with UM, and from healthy or severely ill malaria-negative children.

We hypothesized that IFN‐λ3 polymorphism may modulate NK cell function during acute HCV. METHODS: We monitored the plasma levels of type III IFNs in relation to the phenotype and the function of NK cells in a cohort of people who inject drugs (PWID) during acute HCV infection with different outcomes. RESULTS: Early acute HCV was associated with high variability in type III IFNs plasma levels and the favorable IFN‐λ3 CC genotype was associated with higher viral loads. Reduced expression of Natural Killer Group Protein 2A (NKG2A) was associated with lower IFN‐λ3 plasma levels and the CC genotype. IFN‐γ production by NK cells was higher in individuals with the CC genotype during acute infection but this did not prevent viral persistence. IFN‐λ3 plasma levels did not correlate with function of NK cells and IFN‐λ3 prestimulation did not affect NK cell activation and function. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IFN‐λ3 polymorphism indirectly influences NK cell phenotype and function during acute HCV but other factors may act in concert to determine the outcome of the infection.,2016-08-16,"Depla, Marion; Pelletier, Sandy; Bédard, Nathalie; Brunaud, Camille; Bruneau, Julie; Shoukry, Naglaa H.",Immun Inflamm Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a89e429d097935acb1c9cf5baf8d2c69f292cbee.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5004291.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5004291/,

'Open Access' publishing is expected to become an increasingly important format for peer reviewed academic journals and that Globalization and Health is 'Open Access' is appropriate. The rationale behind starting a journal dedicated to globalization and health is three fold: Firstly: Globalization is reshaping the social geography within which we might strive to create health or prevent disease. The determinants of health – be they a SARS virus or a predilection for fatty foods – have joined us in our global mobility. Driven by economic liberalization and changing technologies, the phenomenon of 'access' is likely to dominate to an increasing extent the unfolding experience of human disease and wellbeing. Secondly: Understanding globalization as a subject matter itself needs certain benchmarks and barometers of its successes and failings. Health is one such barometer. It is a marker of social infrastructure and social welfare and as such can be used to either sound an alarm or give a victory cheer as our interconnectedness hurts and heals the populations we serve. And lastly: In as much as globalization can have an effect on health, it is also true that health and disease has an effect on globalization as exemplified by the existence of quarantine laws and the devastating economic effects of the AIDS pandemic. A balanced view would propose that the effects of globalization on health (and health systems) are neither universally good nor bad, but rather context specific.

Although the search for the natural reservoirs of the ebolaviruses has largely involved serosurveillance of the bat population, there are no validated serological assays to screen bat sera for ebolavirus-specific IgG antibodies. Here, we generate filovirus-specific antisera by prime-boost immunization of groups of captive ERBs with all seven known culturable filoviruses. After validating a system of filovirus-specific indirect ELISAs utilizing infectious-based virus antigens for detection of virus-specific IgG antibodies from bat sera, we assess the level of serological cross-reactivity between the virus-specific antisera and heterologous filovirus antigens.

The ability of influenza vaccines to elicit CD4(+) T cells and the relationship between induction of CD4(+) T cells and vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses has been controversial. The emergence of swine-origin 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A[H1N1]pdm09) provided a unique opportunity to examine responses to an influenza vaccine composed of both novel and previously encountered antigens and to probe the relationship between B-cell and T-cell responses to vaccination. Methods. We tracked CD4(+) T-cell and antibody responses of human subjects vaccinated with monovalent subunit A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine. The specificity and magnitude of the CD4(+) T-cell response was evaluated using cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays in conjugation with peptide pools representing distinct influenza virus proteins. Results. Our studies revealed that vaccination induced readily detectable CD4(+) T cells specific for conserved portions of hemagglutinin (HA) and the internal viral proteins. Interestingly, expansion of HA-specific CD4(+) T cells was most tightly correlated with the antibody response. Conclusions. These results indicate that CD4(+) T-cell expansion may be a limiting factor in development of neutralizing antibody responses to pandemic influenza vaccines and suggest that approaches to facilitate CD4(+) T-cell recruitment may increase the neutralizing antibody produced in response to vaccines against novel influenza strains.",2013-01-15,"Nayak, Jennifer L.; Fitzgerald, Theresa F.; Richards, Katherine A.; Yang, Hongmei; Treanor, John J.; Sant, Andrea J.",J Infect Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/33a8980d8afda0140d74e92374c2deab725f019e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3532833.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3532833/,

METHODS: A search for relevant publications was conducted in Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, African Index Medicus and Lilacs databases. Retrieved studies were evaluated in terms of objectives, diseases studied, data sources, methodologies and performance for real-time surveillance. Most studies compared drug sales data to reference surveillance data using correlation measurements or indicators of outbreak detection performance (sensitivity, specificity, timeliness of the detection). RESULTS: We screened 3266 articles and included 27 in the review. Most studies focused on acute respiratory and gastroenteritis infections. Nineteen studies retrospectively compared drug sales data to reference clinical data, and significant correlations were observed in 17 of them. Four studies found that over-the-counter drug sales preceded clinical data in terms of incidence increase. Five studies developed and evaluated statistical algorithms for selecting drug groups to monitor specific diseases. Another three studies developed models to predict incidence increase from drug sales. CONCLUSIONS: Drug sales data analyses appear to be a useful tool for surveillance of gastrointestinal and respiratory disease, and OTC drugs have the potential for early outbreak detection. Their utility remains to be investigated for other diseases, in particular those poorly surveyed.

However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous because they may allow for increased adaptability. This argument has profound implications because it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here, we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D(G64S), has a significant replication defect and that wild-type (WT) and 3D(G64S) populations have similar adaptability in 2 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3D(G64S) under selection for replicative speed led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3D(G64S) exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the lethal level, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3D(G64S) growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy. In contrast with what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within-host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity.",2018-06-28,"Fitzsimmons, William J.; Woods, Robert J.; McCrone, John T.; Woodman, Andrew; Arnold, Jamie J.; Yennawar, Madhumita; Evans, Richard; Cameron, Craig E.; Lauring, Adam S.",PLoS Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/59cdfbf3b9e99d780b3ad6cf2985e34ec61e8f5a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6040757.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6040757/,

Recent studies found that NMC was rarely performed in Thailand and that most Thai health professionals did not recognize that NMC could reduce the risk of HIV infection and would not want NMC services in their hospitals. This study explored the thoughts and concerns of Thai government health staff regarding the introduction of NMC in government health facilities as a public health measure. METHODS: In-depth interviews with physicians, nurses and physician administrators from four different levels of government hospitals in four provinces representing 4 regions of Thailand were conducted after provision of education regarding the benefits and risks of NMC. Interviews were audio recorded and analyzed using Atlas.ti software to develop themes. RESULTS: Six themes emerged from the data of 42 respondents: understanding of the benefits of NMC; risks of NMC; need for a pilot project; need for staff training and hospital readiness; need for parental/family education; and need for public awareness educational campaign. Major concerns included possible medical complications of NMC, infringement of child rights, and lack of understanding from staff and parents. The respondents emphasized the need for a clear policy, proper training of staff, financial and equipment support, and piloting NMC rollout before this measure could be fully implemented. CONCLUSIONS: Thai health professionals who took part in this study expressed several concerns if NMC had to be performed in their health care facilities. There is significant preparation that needs to be done before NMC can be introduced in the country.

Consequently, lentiviral-vector-based gene therapy is limited to incurable human diseases, with little understanding of the underlying causes of adverse effects and poor efficacy. To assess the role that host genetic variation has on efficacy of gene therapy, we characterized lentiviral-vector gene therapy within a set of 12 collaborative cross mouse strains. Lentiviral vectors carrying the firefly luciferase cDNA under the control of a liver-specific promoter were administered to female mice, with total-body and hepatic luciferase expression periodically monitored through 41 weeks post-vector administration.

Previous pandemics have led to stockpiling of goods, the victimisation of particular population groups, and the cancellation of travel and the boycotting of particular foods (e.g. pork). We examined initial behavioural and attitudinal responses towards Influenza A, H1N1 (""Swine flu"") in the six days following the WHO pandemic alert level 5, and regional differences in these responses. METHODS: 328 respondents completed a cross-sectional Internet or paper-based questionnaire study in Malaysia (N = 180) or Europe (N = 148). Measures assessed changes in transport usage, purchase of preparatory goods for a pandemic, perceived risk groups, indicators of anxiety, assessed estimated mortality rates for seasonal flu, effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccination, and changes in pork consumption RESULTS: 26% of the respondents were 'very concerned' about being a flu victim (42% Malaysians, 5% Europeans, p < .001). 36% reported reduced public transport use (48% Malaysia, 22% Europe, p < .001), 39% flight cancellations (56% Malaysia, 17% Europe, p < .001). 8% had purchased preparatory materials (e.g. face masks: 8% Malaysia, 7% Europe), 41% Malaysia (15% Europe) intended to do so (p < .001). 63% of Europeans, 19% of Malaysians had discussed the pandemic with friends (p < .001). Groups seen as at 'high risk' of infection included the immune compromised (mentioned by 87% respondents), pig farmers (70%), elderly (57%), prostitutes/highly sexually active (53%), and the homeless (53%). In data collected only in Europe, 64% greatly underestimated the mortality rates of seasonal flu, 26% believed seasonal flu vaccination gave protection against swine flu. 7% had reduced/stopped eating pork. 3% had purchased anti-viral drugs for use at home, while 32% intended to do so if the pandemic worsened. CONCLUSION: Initial responses to Influenza A show large regional differences in anxiety, with Malaysians more anxious and more likely to reduce travel and to buy masks and food. Discussions with family and friends may reinforce existing anxiety levels. Particular groups (homosexuals, prostitutes, the homeless) are perceived as at greater risk, potentially leading to increased prejudice during a pandemic.

Here, we show that the absence of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) in genetic knock-out mice strongly abrogates pyroptosis in AMs and alleviates the LPS-induced lung injury and systemic inflammation. Our study demonstrates that IRF-1 contributes to caspase-1 activation and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain pyroptosome formation in AMs and leads to downstream inflammatory cytokine release, including that of IL-1β, IL-18, and HMGB1. The nuclear translocation of IRF-1 is linked to the presence of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).

In the Netherlands, all deaths associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection had to be notified, both during the 2009-2010 pandemic season and the 2010-2011 influenza season. To assess whether and to what extent pandemic mortality patterns were reverting back to seasonal patterns, a retrospective analyses of all notified fatal cases associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection was performed. METHODS: The notification database, including detailed information about the clinical characteristics of all notified deaths, was used to perform a comprehensive analysis of all deceased patients with a laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection. Characteristics of the fatalities with respect to age and underlying medical conditions were analysed, comparing the 2009-2010 pandemic and the 2010-2011 influenza season.

In Europe, members of the genus Culex are often the most abundant insects on cave walls. Culex pipiens L., the common house mosquito, exists in two physically very similar, yet genetically and ecologically distinct biotypes (or forms, ‘f.’), namely Cx. pipiens f. pipiens and Cx. pipiens f. molestus. Autogeny and stenogamy of the latter form have been interpreted as adaptations to underground habitats. The epigean occurrence of the two biotypes and their hybrids was recently examined in Eastern Austria, but the hypogean distribution of the Cx. pipiens complex and morphologically similar non-members such as Cx. torrentium is unknown. Considering the key role of Culex mosquitoes in the epidemiology of certain zoonotic pathogens, the general paucity of data on species composition and relative abundance in subterranean shelters appears unfortunate. For a first pertinent investigation in Austria, we collected mosquitoes in four eastern federal states. Based on analyses of the ACE2 gene and the CQ11 microsatellite locus, 150 female and three male mosquitoes of the genus Culex, two females of the genus Culiseta and a single female of the genus Anopheles were determined to species level or below. In our catches, Cx. pipiens f. pipiens exceeded the apparent abundance of the purportedly cave-adapted Cx. pipiens f. molestus many times over.

Although, the IL-33 levels increased in sera of viral hepatitis patients in human, the cellular sources of IL-33 in viral hepatitis remained obscure. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the expression of IL-33 in murine fulminant hepatitis induced by a Toll like receptor (TLR3) viral mimetic, poly(I:C) or by pathogenic mouse hepatitis virus (L2-MHV3). The administration of poly(I:C) plus D-galactosamine (D-GalN) in mice led to acute liver injury associated with the induction of IL-33 expression in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and vascular endothelial cells (VEC), while the administration of poly(I:C) alone led to hepatocyte specific IL-33 expression in addition to vascular IL-33 expression. The hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was down-regulated in NK-depleted poly(I:C) treated mice suggesting a partial regulation of IL-33 by NK cells. The CD1d KO (NKT deficient) mice showed hepatoprotection against poly(I:C)-induced hepatitis in association with increased number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes in CD1d KO mice than WT controls. These results suggest that hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression in poly(I:C) induced liver injury was partially dependent of NK cells and with limited role of NKT cells. In parallel, the L2-MHV3 infection in mice induced fulminant hepatitis associated with up-regulated IL-33 expression as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine microenvironment in liver. The LSEC and VEC expressed inducible expression of IL-33 following L2-MHV3 infection but the hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was only evident between 24 to 32h of post infection.

Being the most common infectious species of the Pseudomonas genus, P. aeruginosa is the primary Gram-negative etiology responsible for nosocomial infections. Due to the ubiquity and high adaptability of this species, an effective universal treatment method for P. aeruginosa infection still eludes investigators, despite the extensive research in this area. RESULTS: We report bacterial inhibition by iron-oxide (nominally magnetite) nanoparticles (NPs) alone, having a mean hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 16 nm, as well as alginate-capped iron-oxide NPs. Alginate capping increased the average hydrodynamic diameter to ~ 230 nm. We also investigated alginate-capped iron-oxide NP-drug conjugates, with a practically unchanged hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 232 nm. Susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the NPs, NP-tobramycin conjugates, and tobramycin alone were determined in the PAO1 bacterial colonies. Investigations into susceptibility using the disk diffusion method were done after 3 days of biofilm growth and after 60 days of growth. MIC of all compounds of interest was determined after 60-days of growth, to ensure thorough establishment of biofilm colonies. CONCLUSIONS: Positive inhibition is reported for uncapped and alginate-capped iron-oxide NPs, and the corresponding MICs are presented. We report zero susceptibility to iron-oxide NPs capped with polyethylene glycol, suggesting that the capping agent plays a major role in enabling bactericidal ability in of the nanocomposite. Our findings suggest that the alginate-coated nanocomposites investigated in this study have the potential to overcome the bacterial biofilm barrier. Magnetic field application increases the action, likely via enhanced diffusion of the iron-oxide NPs and NP-drug conjugates through mucin and alginate barriers, which are characteristic of cystic-fibrosis respiratory infections. We demonstrate that iron-oxide NPs coated with alginate, as well as alginate-coated magnetite–tobramycin conjugates inhibit P. aeruginosa growth and biofilm formation in established colonies. We have also determined that susceptibility to tobramycin decreases for longer culture times. However, susceptibility to the iron-oxide NP compounds did not demonstrate any comparable decrease with increasing culture time. These findings imply that iron-oxide NPs are promising lower-cost alternatives to silver NPs in antibacterial coatings, solutions, and drugs, as well as other applications in which microbial abolition or infestation prevention is sought.",2020-02-18,"Armijo, Leisha M.; Wawrzyniec, Stephen J.; Kopciuch, Michael; Brandt, Yekaterina I.; Rivera, Antonio C.; Withers, Nathan J.; Cook, Nathaniel C.; Huber, Dale L.; Monson, Todd C.; Smyth, Hugh D.

However, certain topic areas lack representation in terms of the quantity and quality of review literature available. The objectives of this paper are to identify the quantity, as well as quality, of review-level evidence available on the effectiveness of public health interventions for public health decision makers. METHODS: Searches conducted on http://www.health-evidence.ca produced an inventory of public health review literature in 21 topic areas. Gaps and areas of wealth in the review literature, as well as the proportion of reviews rated methodologically strong, moderate, or weak were identified. The top 10 topic areas of interest for registered users and visitors of http://www.health-evidence.ca were extracted from user profile data and Google Analytics. RESULTS: Registered users' top three interests included: 1) healthy communities, 2) chronic diseases, and 3) nutrition. The top three preferences for visitors included: 1) chronic diseases, 2) physical activity, and 3) addiction/substance use. All of the topic areas with many (301+) available reviews were of interest to registered users and/or visitors (mental health, physical activity, addiction/substance use, adolescent health, child health, nutrition, adult health, and chronic diseases). Conversely, the majority of registered users and/or visitors did not have preference for topic areas with few (≤ 150) available reviews (food safety and inspection, dental health, environmental health) with the exception of social determinants of health and healthy communities. Across registered users' and visitors' topic areas of preference, 80.2% of the reviews were of well-done methodological quality, with 43.5% of reviews having a strong quality rating and 36.7% a moderate review quality rating. CONCLUSIONS: In topic areas in which many reviews are available, higher level syntheses are needed to guide policy and practice. For other topic areas with few reviews, it is necessary to determine whether primary study evidence exists, or is needed, so that reviews can be conducted in the future. Considering that less than half of the reviews available on http://www.health-evidence.ca are of strong methodological quality, the quality of the review-level evidence needs to improve across the range of public health topic areas.",2011-10-03,"Tirilis, Daiva; Husson, Heather; DeCorby, Kara; Dobbins, Maureen",BMC Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9ba1128dfcbbe8a753c6e1a7dbeed0e95a981917.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3229615.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229615/,

No effective drugs are available clinically on toxoplasmosis. Chinese traditional herbal medicines have provided remedies for many health problems. There exists a possibility that Chinese herbs may provide protection against T. gondii. This work aims to assess the protective efficacy of combined Chinese herbs against T. gondii. We screened five herbal medicines that have different pharmacological effects and combined them into a prescription according to the traditional Chinese medicine compatibility principle. The drug potential and protective efficacy were evaluated through a mouse model by determining the survival time, the parasite load in blood and tissues, the change of cell proportions in blood and histological detection. The results showed that the survival time of mice in the 500 mg Chinese herbs group and sulfadiazine group was significantly longer than that of the PBS control group. Also the parasite load in blood and tissues of 500 mg Chinese herbs and sulfadiazine groups was significantly lower than that of PBS group at 7 days post infection (dpi), which was in accordance with the result of histological detection. Monocyte and neutrophil of infected mice were remarkably increased while lymphocyte was dramatically decreased compared to that of blank group at 7 dpi.

Natural selection has favored these viruses to be retained in the phloem to facilitate acquisition and transmission by aphids. We show that treatment of infected oat tissue homogenate with sodium sulfite reduces transmission of the purified virus by aphids. Transmission electron microscopy data indicated no gross change in virion morphology due to treatments. However, treated virions were not acquired by aphids through the hindgut epithelial cells and were not transmitted when injected directly into the hemocoel. Analysis of virus preparations using nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry revealed a number of host plant proteins co-purifying with viruses, some of which were lost following sodium sulfite treatment. Using targeted mass spectrometry, we show data suggesting that several of the virus-associated host plant proteins accumulated to higher levels in aphids that were fed on CYDV-infected plants compared to healthy plants. We propose two hypotheses to explain these observations, and these are not mutually exclusive: (a) that sodium sulfite treatment disrupts critical virion-host protein interactions required for aphid transmission, or (b) that host infection with CYDV modulates phloem protein expression in a way that is favorable for virus uptake by aphids.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 2 1/2 years old girl was diagnosed as having alveolar proteinosis. Whole lung lavages were performed with a new catheter balloon technique, feasible in small sized airways. Because of some interstitial inflammation in the lung biopsy and to further improve the condition, empirical therapy with systemic steroids and azathioprin, and inhaled and subcutaneous GMCSF, were used. Based on clinical measures, total protein and lipid recovered by whole lung lavages, all these treatments were without benefit. Conversely, severe respiratory viral infections and an invasive aspergillosis with aspergilloma formation occurred. Recently the novel homozygous stop mutation p.Ser25X of the GMCSF receptor alpha chain was identified in the patient. This mutation leads to a lack of functional GMCSF receptor and a reduced response to GMCSF stimulation of CD11b expression of mononuclear cells of the patient. Subsequently a very intense treatment with monthly lavages was initiated, resulting for the first time in complete resolution of partial respiratory insufficiency and a significant improvement of the overall somato-psychosocial condition of the child.

In the current work, the effect of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by lactic acid bacteria from different genera on the structural and functional characteristics of cells and the development of adenoviral infection in vitro was studied. Materials and Methods: Cytotoxicity of six EPSs of lactic acid bacteria of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus was determined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. The influence of the EPSs on the infectivity of human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5) and on the cell cycle under a condition of adenovirus infection was studied using plaque reduction assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Results: It was shown that exopolysaccharides were non-toxic to Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (MDBK) as they reduced their viability by 3–17%. A change in the distribution of the cell cycle phases in the non-infected cell population treated with EPSs was observed. The analysis demonstrated an increase in the number of cells in the S phase by 47% when using EPSs 15a and a decrease in the number of cells in the G1 phase by 20–27% when treated with the EPSs 15a, 33a, and 19s. The use of EPSs did not led to the normalization of the life cycle of HAdV-5 infected cells to the level of non-infected cells. The EPSs showed low virucidal activity and reduced the HAdV-5 infectivity to 85%. Among the studied exopolysaccharides, anti-adenovirus activity was found for EPS 26a that is produced by Lactobacillus spp. strain. The treatment of cells with the EPS following virus adsorption completely (100%) suppressed the formation and release of HAdV-5 infectious.

Isothermal amplification techniques, such as reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), exhibit characteristics that are ideal for the development of a rapid nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) because they are quick, easy to perform and do not require complex, dedicated equipment and laboratory space. In this study, we assessed the ability of the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay to detect acute HIV infection as compared to a representative rapid antibody test and several FDA-approved laboratory-based assays. The HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay detected seroconverting individuals one to three weeks earlier than a rapid HIV antibody test and up to two weeks earlier than a lab-based antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combo enzyme immunoassay (EIA). RT-LAMP was not as sensitive as a lab-based qualitative RNA assay, which could be attributed to the significantly smaller nucleic acid input volume. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of detecting acute HIV infection using the RT-LAMP assay. The availability of a rapid NAAT, such as the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay, at the point of care (POC) or in laboratories that do not have access to large platform NAAT could increase the percentage of individuals who receive an acute HIV infection status or confirmation of their HIV status, while immediately linking them to counseling and medical care.

To examine coxsackievirus pathogenesis, we orally inoculated mice with the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) Nancy strain. Using HeLa cell plaque assays with agar overlays, we noticed that some fecal viruses generated plaques >100 times as large as inoculum viruses. These large-plaque variants emerged following viral replication in several different tissues. We identified a single amino acid change, N63Y, in the VP3 capsid protein that was sufficient to confer the large-plaque phenotype. Wild-type CVB3 and N63Y mutant CVB3 had similar plaque sizes when agarose was used in the overlay instead of agar. We determined that sulfated glycans in agar inhibited plaque formation by wild-type CVB3 but not by N63Y mutant CVB3. Furthermore, N63Y mutant CVB3 bound heparin, a sulfated glycan, less efficiently than wild-type CVB3 did. While N63Y mutant CVB3 had a growth defect in cultured cells and reduced attachment, it had enhanced replication and pathogenesis in mice.

METHODS, FINDINGS: Patients with systolic HF (NYHAII-IV, enrolled for cardiac resynchronisation therapy, CRT, n = 100) were compared to hypertensive patients (n = 239) and to a healthy cohort (n = 45) with preserved ejection fraction (EF>50%) in a single center prospective clinical study. The status of the heart failure patients were checked before and after CRT. Biochemical (ACE and sACE2 activity, ACE concentration) and echocardiographic parameters (EF, left ventricular end-diastolic (EDD) and end-systolic diameter (ESD) and dP/dt) were measured. sACE2 activity negatively correlated with EF and positively with ESD and EDD in all patient's populations, while it was independent in the healthy cohort. sACE2 activity was already increased in the hypertensive group, where signs for imminent heart failure (slightly decreased EF and barely increased NT-proBNP levels) were detected. sACE2 activities further increased in patients with definitive heart failure (EF<50%), while sACE2 activities decreased with the improvement of the heart failure after CRT (reverse remodeling). Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) concentrations were lower in the diseased populations, but did not show a strong correlation with the echocardiographic parameters.

To assess whether these procedures are performed, a valid set of quality indicators (QIs) is required. The goal of this study was to select a set of key recommendations that can be systematically translated into QIs to measure the quality of infectious disease outbreak response from the perspective of disaster emergency responders and infectious disease control professionals. METHODS: Applying the Rand modified Delphi procedure, the following steps were taken to systematically select a set of key recommendations: extraction of recommendations from relevant literature; appraisal of the recommendations in terms of relevance through questionnaires to experts; expert meeting to discuss recommendations; prioritization of recommendations through a second questionnaire; and final expert meeting to approve the selected set. Infectious disease physicians and nurses, policymakers and communication experts participated in the expert group (n = 48). RESULTS: In total, 54 national and international publications were systematically searched for recommendations, yielding over 200 recommendations. The Rand modified Delphi procedure resulted in a set of 65 key recommendations. The key recommendations were categorized into 10 domains describing the whole response pathway from outbreak recognition to aftercare. CONCLUSION: This study provides a set of key recommendations that represents ‘good quality of response to an infectious disease outbreak’. These key recommendations can be systematically translated into QIs. Organizations and professionals involved in outbreak control can use these QIs to monitor the quality of response to infectious disease outbreaks and to assess in which domains improvement is needed.

The therapeutic effectiveness of nucleoside analogues can be dramatically improved by phosphorylation. The ProTide approach was developed using a phosphorylated nucleoside that is masked by esterification with an amino acid and phenol forming a chiral phosphorus center. The biological activity of the ProTides depends, in part, on the stereochemistry at phosphorus, and thus, it is imperative that efficient methods be developed for the chemical synthesis and isolation of diastereomerically pure ProTides. Chiral ProTides are often synthesized by direct displacement of a labile phenol (p-nitrophenol or pentafluorophenol) from a chiral phosphoramidate precursor with the appropriate nucleoside analogue. The ability to produce these chiral products is dictated by the synthesis of the chiral phosphoramidate precursors. The enzyme phosphotriesterase (PTE) from Pseudomonas diminuta is well-known for its high stereoselectivity and broad substrate profile. Screening PTE variants from enzyme evolution libraries enabled the identification of variants of PTE that can stereoselectively hydrolyze the chiral phosphoramidate precursors. The variant G60A-PTE exhibits a 165-fold preference for hydrolysis of the R(P) isomer, while the variant In1W-PTE has a 1400-fold preference for hydrolysis of the S(P) isomer. Using these mutants of PTE, the S(P) and R(P) isomers were isolated on a preparative scale with no detectable contamination of the opposite isomer.

The clinical features and outcomes of the most critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by HAdV-55 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-center observational study of pneumonia with ARDS in immunocompetent adults admitted to our respiratory ICU. We prospectively collected and analyzed clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, sequential tests of viral load in respiratory tract and blood, treatments and outcomes. RESULTS: The results for a total of five consecutive patients with severe ARDS with confirmed HAdV-55 infection were included. All five patients were immunocompetent young men with a median age of 32 years. The mean time from onset to dyspnea was 5 days. Arterial blood gas analysis at ICU admission revealed profound hypoxia. Mean partial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen was 58.1. Mean durations from onset to a single-lobe consolidation shown on chest X-rays (CXRs) and, from the first positive CXR to bilateral multilobar lung infiltrates, were 2 days and 4.8 days, respectively. The viral load was higher than 1 × 10(8) copies in three patients and was 1 × 10(4) in one patient. It was negative in the only patient who survived. The mean duration for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) failure and IMV failure were 30.8 hours and 6.2 days, respectively. Four patients received venovenous ECMO. Four (80%) of the five patients died despite receiving appropriate respiratory support. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV-55 may cause severe ARDS in immunocompetent young men. Persistent high fever, dyspnea and rapid progression to respiratory failure within 2 weeks, together with bilateral consolidations and infiltrates, are the most frequent clinical manifestations of HAdV-55-induced severe ARDS. Viral load monitoring may help predict disease severity and outcome. The NPPV and IMV failure rates were very high, but ECMO may still be the respiratory support therapy of choice.

In BHI and LAPT culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different pHs were tested. IASOS exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. The results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced IASOS efficacy only to a moderate extent. Whereas comparable MBCs (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) were observed for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L Ag(+)), E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L Ag(+)) in both media, higher MBCs were found for S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT cultures (50 mg/L Ag(+) versus 25 mg/L Ag(+)). No minimal concentration totally inhibiting the growth of C. albicans was found. Nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50–200 mg/L Ag(+)), a significant 34–52% drop in Candida growth was observed. pH differently affected the antimicrobial properties of IASOS against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at pH higher than the physiological pH was generally observed. It can be therefore concluded that IASOS exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against C. albicans. The antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel SilSOS Femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of IASOS.

It is commonly believed that adaptive immunity drives clearance of viral infections and, thus, dysfunction or viral evasion of adaptive immunity is required for a virus to persist. Type I interferons (IFNs) play pleiotropic roles in the antiviral response, including through innate control of viral replication. Murine norovirus (MNoV) replicates in dendritic cells (DCs) and type I IFN signaling in DCs is important for early control of MNoV replication. We show here that the non-persistent MNoV strain CW3 persists systemically when CD11c positive DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. Persistence in this setting is associated with increased early viral titers, maintenance of DC numbers, increased expression of DC activation markers and an increase in CD8 T cell and antibody responses. Furthermore, CD8 T cell function is maintained during the persistent phase of infection and adaptive immune cells from persistently infected mice are functional when transferred to Rag1 (-/-) recipients. Finally, increased early replication and persistence are also observed in mixed bone marrow chimeras where only half of the CD11c positive DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. These findings demonstrate that increased early viral replication due to a cell-intrinsic innate immune deficiency is sufficient for persistence and a functional adaptive immune response is not sufficient for viral clearance.",2016-06-21,"Nice, Timothy J.; Osborne, Lisa C.; Tomov, Vesselin T.; Artis, David; Wherry, E.

During blood-feeding, sand fly females salivate into the skin of the host. Sand fly saliva contains a large variety of proteins, some of which elicit specific antibody responses in the bitten hosts. To evaluate the exposure to sand fly bites in human populations from disease endemic areas, we tested the antibody reactions of volunteers' sera against recombinant P. orientalis salivary antigens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Recombinant proteins derived from sequence data on P. orientalis secreted salivary proteins, were produced using either bacterial (five proteins) or mammalian (four proteins) expression systems and tested as antigens applicable for detection of anti-P. orientalis IgG in human sera. Using these recombinant proteins, human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia, countries endemic for visceral leishmaniasis, were screened by ELISA and immunoblotting to identify the potential markers of exposure to P. orientalis bites. Two recombinant proteins; mAG5 and mYEL1, were identified as the most promising antigens showing high correlation coefficients as well as good specificity in comparison to the whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate. Combination of both proteins led to a further increase of correlation coefficients as well as both positive and negative predictive values of P. orientalis exposure. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report of screening human sera for anti-P. orientalis antibodies using recombinant salivary proteins.

We propose that the progression of cancer cells towards malignant phenotypes can be efficiently tracked using high-throughput technologies that follow the gradual changes observed in the gene expression profiles by employing Shannon's mathematical theory of communication. Methods based on Information Theory can then quantify the divergence of cancer cells' transcriptional profiles from those of normally appearing cells of the originating tissues. The relevance of the proposed methods can be evaluated using microarray datasets available in the public domain but the method is in principle applicable to other high-throughput methods. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using melanoma and prostate cancer datasets we illustrate how it is possible to employ Shannon Entropy and the Jensen-Shannon divergence to trace the transcriptional changes progression of the disease. We establish how the variations of these two measures correlate with established biomarkers of cancer progression. The Information Theory measures allow us to identify novel biomarkers for both progressive and relatively more sudden transcriptional changes leading to malignant phenotypes. At the same time, the methodology was able to validate a large number of genes and processes that seem to be implicated in the progression of melanoma and prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We thus present a quantitative guiding rule, a new unifying hallmark of cancer: the cancer cell's transcriptome changes lead to measurable observed transitions of Normalized Shannon Entropy values (as measured by high-througput technologies). At the same time, tumor cells increment their divergence from the normal tissue profile increasing their disorder via creation of states that we might not directly measure. This unifying hallmark allows, via the the Jensen-Shannon divergence, to identify the arrow of time of the processes from the gene expression profiles, and helps to map the phenotypical and molecular hallmarks of specific cancer subtypes.

At the same time, twenty-first century states are increasingly concerned that this data could also be used for purposes of bioterrorism. There is thus a tension between the desire to promote the sharing of data, as encapsulated by the Open Data movement, and the desire to prevent this data from ‘falling into the wrong hands’ as represented by ‘dual use’ policies. Both frameworks posit a moral duty for life sciences researchers with respect to how they should make their data available. However, Open data and dual use concerns are rarely discussed in concert and their implementation can present scientists with potentially conflicting ethical requirements. DISCUSSION: Both dual use and Open data policies frame scientific data and data dissemination in particular, though different, ways. As such they contain implicit models for how data is translated. Both approaches are limited by a focus on abstract conceptions of data and data sharing. This works to impede consensus-building between the two ethical frameworks. As an alternative, this paper proposes that an ethics of responsible management of scientific data should be based on a more nuanced understanding of the everyday data practices of life scientists. Responsibility for these ‘micromovements’ of data must consider the needs and duties of scientists as individuals and as collectively-organised groups. SUMMARY: Researchers in the life sciences are faced with conflicting ethical responsibilities to share data as widely as possible, but prevent it being used for bioterrorist purposes. In order to reconcile the responsibilities posed by the Open Data and dual use frameworks, approaches should focus more on the everyday practices of laboratory scientists and less on abstract conceptions of data.",2016-05-17,"Bezuidenhout, Louise M.; Morrison, Michael",BMC Med Ethics,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2f2a4d172b340b6f695a3f44bb746edcccb47d14.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4869374.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869374/,

However, the molecular mechanism of silkworm resistance to BmNPV remains largely unknown. Here, the recurrent parent P50 (susceptible strain) and the near-isogenic line BC9 (resistance strain) were used in a comparative transcriptome study examining the response to infection with BmNPV. A total of 14,300 unigenes were obtained from two different resistant strains; of these, 869 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after comparing the four transcriptomes. Many DEGs associated with protein metabolism, cytoskeleton, and apoptosis may be involved in the host response to BmNPV infection. Moreover, some immunity related genes were also altered following BmNPV infection. Specifically, after removing genetic background and individual immune stress response genes, 22 genes were found to be potentially involved in repressing BmNPV infection. These genes were related to transport, virus replication, intracellular innate immune, and apoptosis. Our study provided an overview of the molecular mechanism of silkworm resistance to BmNPV infection and laid a foundation for controlling BmNPV in the future.",2016-05-11,"Wang, Xue-Yang; Yu, Hai-Zhong; Geng, Lei; Xu, Jia-Ping; Yu, Dong; Zhang, Shang-Zhi; Ma, Yan; Fei, Dong-Qiong",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/345a04a8633d593b5a400b559d533a6b4595f490.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4864234.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4864234/,

Immune-enhancing enteral formula has been proven to significantly reduce infection rate in TBI patients. One of the ingredients that can be used in immunonutrition formulas to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress is pycnogenol. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work is to survey the effect of pycnogenol on the clinical, nutritional, and inflammatory status of TBI patients. METHODS: This is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Block randomization will be used. An intervention group will receive pycnogenol supplementation of 150 mg for 10 days and a control group will receive a placebo for the same duration. Inflammatory status (IL-6, IL- 1β, C-reactive protein) and oxidative stress status (malondialdehyde, total antioxidant capacity), at the baseline, at the 5th day, and at the end of the study (10th day) will be measured. Clinical and nutritional status will be assessed three times during the intervention. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) questionnaire for assessment of organ failure will be filled out every other day. The mortality rate will be calculated within 28 days of the start of the intervention. Weight, body mass index, and body composition will be measured. All analyses will be conducted by an initially assigned study arm in an intention-to-treat analysis.

DESIGN: HIV-1 pol sequence data were analyzed to infer the local transmission network. METHODS: We analyzed HIV-1 pol sequence data to infer a partial local transmission network among 478 recently HIV-1 infected persons and 170 of their sexual and social contacts in San Diego, California. A transmission network score (TNS) was developed to estimate the risk of HIV transmission from a newly diagnosed individual to a new partner and target prevention interventions. RESULTS: HIV-1 pol sequences from 339 individuals (52.3%) were highly similar to sequences from at least one other participant (i.e., clustered). A high TNS (top 25%) was significantly correlated with baseline risk behaviors (number of unique sexual partners and insertive unprotected anal intercourse (p = 0.014 and p = 0.0455, respectively) and predicted risk of transmission (p<0.0001). Retrospective analysis of antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, and simulations of ART targeted to individuals with the highest TNS, showed significantly reduced network level HIV transmission (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sequence data from an HIV-1 screening program focused on recently infected persons and their social and sexual contacts enabled the characterization of a highly connected transmission network.

Here, we aimed to identify an effective, safe, and affordable antiviral agent for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of RSV infection in children at high risk. We found that maleic anhydride (ML)-modified human serum albumin (HSA), designated ML-HSA, exhibited potent antiviral activity against RSV and that the percentages of the modified lysines and arginies in ML- are correlated with such anti-RSV activity. ML-HSA inhibited RSV entry and replication by interacting with viral G protein and blocking RSV attachment to the target cells, while ML-HAS neither bound to F protein, nor inhibited F protein-mediated membrane fusion. Intranasal administration of ML-HSA before RSV infection resulted in significant decrease of the viral titers in the lungs of mice.

Here, we show that FLJ11286, which we refer to as IRAV, is induced by DENV in an interferon-dependent manner, displays antiviral activity against DENV, and localizes to the DENV replication complex. IRAV is an RNA binding protein and localizes to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies) in uninfected cells, where it interacts with the MOV10 RISC complex RNA helicase, suggesting a role for IRAV in the processing of viral RNA. After DENV infection, IRAV, along with MOV10 and Xrn1, localizes to the DENV replication complex and associates with DENV proteins. Depletion of IRAV or MOV10 results in an increase in viral RNA. These data serve to characterize an interferon-stimulated gene with antiviral activity against DENV, as well as to propose a mechanism of activity involving the processing of viral RNA. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus, a member of the family Flaviviridae, can result in a life-threatening illness and has a significant impact on global health. Dengue virus has been shown to be particularly sensitive to the effects of type I interferon; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which interferon-stimulated genes function to inhibit viral replication. A better understanding of the interferon-mediated antiviral response to dengue virus may aid in the development of novel therapeutics. Here, we examine the influence of the interferon-stimulated gene IRAV (FLJ11286) on dengue virus replication. We show that IRAV associates with P bodies in uninfected cells and with the dengue virus replication complex after infection. IRAV also interacts with MOV10, depletion of which is associated with increased viral replication. Our results provide insight into a newly identified antiviral gene, as well as broadening our understanding of the innate immune response to dengue virus infection.",2017-02-14,"Balinsky, Corey A.; Schmeisser, Hana; Wells, Alexandra I.; Ganesan, Sundar; Jin, Tengchuan; Singh, Kavita; Zoon, Kathryn C.",J Virol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b65730c8b239180dd62a079fd2a40f2325a86a78.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5309953.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5309953/,

However, these genes are often implicated in several physiological processes, and long-term inhibition of survival proteins might be accompanied with cytotoxic effects. To avoid this problem, an alternative therapeutic strategy relies on the identification and use of compounds that disrupt specific protein-protein interactions involved in androgen withdrawal. Specifically, the interaction of the chaperone protein Hsp27 with the initiation factor eIF4E leads to the protection of protein synthesis initiation process and enhances cell survival during cell stress induced by castration or chemotherapy. Thus, in this work we aimed at i) identifying the interaction site of the Hsp27/eIF4E complex and ii) interfere with the relevant protein/protein association mechanism involved in castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer. By a combination of experimental and modeling techniques, we proved that eIF4E interacts with the C-terminal part of Hsp27, preferentially when Hsp27 is phosphorylated. We also observed that the loss of this interaction increased cell chemo-and hormone-sensitivity. In order to find a potential inhibitor of Hsp27/eIF4E interaction, BRET assays in combination with molecular simulations identified the phenazine derivative 14 as the compound able to efficiently interfere with this protein/protein interaction, thereby inhibiting cell viability and increasing cell death in chemo- and castration-resistant prostate cancer models in vitro and in vivo.",2017-08-24,"Ziouziou, Hajer; Andrieu, Claudia; Laurini, Erik; Karaki, Sara; Fermeglia, Maurizio; Oueslati, Ridha; Taieb, David; Camplo, Michel; Siri, Olivier; Pricl, Sabrina; Katsogiannou, Maria; Rocchi, Palma",Oncotarget,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0977f51bf118077aae3d344adbe019c40622beb4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5e3f2dabebc87da9fd1323d941ef57df3e7f913b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5652782.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5652782/,

Further, there was no statistical difference in expression levels of TG mRNA in the patients with or without metastasis, and no significant correlation was found between serum TG concentrations and the expression levels of TG mRNA.

We investigated the profile of Th1 and Th17 mediators and interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) in groups with severe and mild nvA(H1N1) disease and correlated them with clinical aspects. METHODS: Thirty-two patients hospitalized with confirmed nvA(H1N1) infection were enrolled in the study: 21 patients with nvA(H1N1)-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 11 patients with mild disease. One group of 20 patients with bacterial sepsis-ARDS and another group of 15 healthy volunteers were added to compare their cytokine levels with pandemic influenza groups. In the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS group, the serum cytokine samples were obtained on admission and 3 days later. The clinical aspects were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: In the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS group, obesity and lymphocytopenia were more common and IP-10, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-15, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-9 were significantly increased versus control. When comparing mild with severe nvA(H1N1) groups, IL-6, IL-8, IL-15 and TNFα were significantly higher in the severe group. In nonsurvivors versus survivors, IL-6 and IL-15 were increased on admission and remained higher 3 days later. A positive correlation of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-15 levels with C-reactive protein and with > 5-day interval between symptom onset and admission, and a negative correlation with the PaO(2):FiO(2 )ratio, were found in nvA(H1N1) groups. In obese patients with influenza disease, a significant increased level of IL-8 was found. When comparing viral ARDS with bacterial ARDS, the level of IL-8, IL-17 and TNFα was significantly higher in bacterial ARDS and IL-12 was increased only in viral ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: In our critically ill patients with novel influenza A(H1N1) virus infection, the hallmarks of the severity of disease were IL-6, IL-15, IL-8 and TNFα. These cytokines, except TNFα, had a positive correlation with the admission delay and C-reactive protein, and a negative correlation with the PaO(2):FiO(2 )ratio.

This process involves rearrangement and destruction of actin filaments, while microtubules become protected throughout the infection. Here the focus is on the intracellular egress pathway, as well as its impact on the properties and release of progeny virions. By colocalization with cellular marker proteins and specific modulation of the pathways through over-expression of variant effector genes transduced by recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors, we show that progeny PV particles become engulfed into COPII-vesicles in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are transported through the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Besides known factors like sar1, sec24, rab1, the ERM family proteins, radixin and moesin play (an) essential role(s) in the formation/loading and targeting of virus-containing COPII-vesicles. These proteins also contribute to the transport through ER and Golgi of the well described analogue of cellular proteins, the secreted Gaussia luciferase in absence of virus infection. It is therefore likely that radixin and moesin also serve for a more general function in cellular exocytosis. Finally, parvovirus egress via ER and Golgi appears to be necessary for virions to gain full infectivity through post-assembly modifications (e.g. phosphorylation). While not being absolutely required for cytolysis and progeny virus release, vesicular transport of parvoviruses through ER and Golgi significantly accelerates these processes pointing to a regulatory role of this transport pathway.",2013-09-19,"Bär, Séverine; Rommelaere, Jean; Nüesch, Jürg P.

Internet search query data have been identified as a valuable source for the detection of emerging influenza epidemics. However, the selection of the search queries and the adoption of prediction methods are crucial challenges when it comes to improving predictions. The purpose of this study was to explore the application of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression model in merging search engine query data and traditional influenza data. METHODS: The official monthly reported number of influenza cases in Liaoning province in China was acquired from the China National Scientific Data Center for Public Health from January 2011 to December 2015. Based on Baidu Index, a publicly available search engine database, search queries potentially related to influenza over the corresponding period were identified. An SVM regression model was built to be used for predictions, and the choice of three parameters (C, γ, ε) in the SVM regression model was determined by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) during the model construction process. The model’s performance was evaluated by the evaluation metrics including Root Mean Square Error, Root Mean Square Percentage Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. RESULTS: In total, 17 search queries related to influenza were generated through the initial query selection approach and were adopted to construct the SVM regression model, including nine queries in the same month, three queries at a lag of one month, one query at a lag of two months and four queries at a lag of three months. The SVM model performed well when with the parameters (C = 2, γ = 0.005, ɛ = 0.0001), based on the ensemble data integrating the influenza surveillance data and Baidu search query data. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated the feasibility of using internet search engine query data as the complementary data source for influenza surveillance and the efficiency of SVM regression model in tracking the influenza epidemics in Liaoning.",2018-06-25,"Liang, Feng; Guan, Peng; Wu, Wei; Huang, Desheng",PeerJ,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/539ebc16737a7d43b43c582f3b625050c2bff9a8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6022725.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6022725/,

Objectives: We quantified potential effects of future climate change on the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of the tick vector of Lyme disease, Ixodes scapularis, and explored their importance for Lyme disease risk, and for vector-borne diseases in general. Methods: We applied observed temperature data for North America and projected temperatures using regional climate models to drive an I. scapularis population model to hindcast recent, and project future, effects of climate warming on R(0). Modeled R(0) increases were compared with R(0) ranges for pathogens and parasites associated with variations in key ecological and epidemiological factors (obtained by literature review) to assess their epidemiological importance. Results: R(0) for I. scapularis in North America increased during the years 1971–2010 in spatio-temporal patterns consistent with observations. Increased temperatures due to projected climate change increased R(0) by factors (2–5 times in Canada and 1.5–2 times in the United States), comparable to observed ranges of R(0) for pathogens and parasites due to variations in strains, geographic locations, epidemics, host and vector densities, and control efforts. Conclusions: Climate warming may have co-driven the emergence of Lyme disease in northeastern North America, and in the future may drive substantial disease spread into new geographic regions and increase tick-borne disease risk where climate is currently suitable. Our findings highlight the potential for climate change to have profound effects on vectors and vector-borne diseases, and the need to refocus efforts to understand these effects.

The chicken IFITM (chIFITM) genes are clustered on chromosome 5 and to date four genes have been annotated, namely chIFITM1, chIFITM3, chIFITM5 and chIFITM10. However, due to poor assembly of this locus in the Gallus Gallus v4 genome, accurate characterization has so far proven problematic. Recently, a new chicken reference genome assembly Gallus Gallus v5 was generated using Sanger, 454, Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies identifying considerable differences in the chIFITM locus over the previous genome releases. METHODS: We re-sequenced the locus using both Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RS II sequencing technologies and we mapped RNA-seq data from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) to this finalized chIFITM locus. Using SureSelect probes capture probes designed to the finalized chIFITM locus, we sequenced the locus of a different chicken breed, namely a White Leghorn, and a turkey. RESULTS: We confirmed the Gallus Gallus v5 consensus except for two insertions of 5 and 1 base pair within the chIFITM3 and B4GALNT4 genes, respectively, and a single base pair deletion within the B4GALNT4 gene. The pull down revealed a single amino acid substitution of A63V in the CIL domain of IFITM2 compared to Red Jungle fowl and 13, 13 and 11 differences between IFITM1, 2 and 3 of chickens and turkeys, respectively. RNA-seq shows chIFITM2 and chIFITM3 expression in numerous tissue types of different chicken breeds and avian cell lines, while the expression of the putative chIFITM1 is limited to the testis, caecum and ileum tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Locus resequencing using these capture probes and RNA-seq based expression analysis will allow the further characterization of genetic diversity within Galliformes.

We assessed the public and philanthropic investments awarded to UK institutions for respiratory infectious disease research to identify areas of underinvestment. We aimed to identify projects and categorise them by pathogen, disease and position along the research and development value chain. SETTING: The UK. PARTICIPANTS: Institutions that host and carry out infectious disease research. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The total amount spent and number of studies with a focus on several different respiratory pathogens or diseases, and to correlate these against the global burden of disease; also the total amount spent and number of studies relating to the type of science, the predominant funder in each category and the mean and median award size. RESULTS: We identified 6165 infectious disease studies with a total investment of £2·6 billion. Respiratory research received £419 million (16.1%) across 1192 (19.3%) studies. The Wellcome Trust provided greatest investment (£135.2 million; 32.3%). Tuberculosis received £155 million (37.1%), influenza £80 million (19.1%) and pneumonia £27.8 million (6.6%). Despite high burden, there was relatively little investment in vaccine-preventable diseases including diphtheria (£0.1 million, 0.03%), measles (£5.0 million, 1.2%) and drug-resistant tuberculosis. There were 802 preclinical studies (67.3%) receiving £273 million (65.2%), while implementation research received £81 million (19.3%) across 274 studies (23%). There were comparatively few phase I–IV trials or product development studies. Global health research received £68.3 million (16.3%). Relative investment was strongly correlated with 2010 disease burden. CONCLUSIONS: The UK predominantly funds preclinical science. Tuberculosis is the most studied respiratory disease. The high global burden of pneumonia-related disease warrants greater investment than it has historically received.

Little is understood regarding how specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3’-end of polycistronic gene arrays in Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of transcription start sites, suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription. In addition, PNUTS loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes involved in host immune evasion.

A conceptual framework for understanding this mental health disparity is minority stress theory, which posits that experiences of external prejudice events (i.e., distal stressors) and internal stress processes such as internalized homophobia and concealment (i.e., proximal stressors) contribute to sexual minorities’ elevated risk of psychological distress. To deepen the understanding of mental health among Chinese MSM and explore the potential utility of minority stress theory in this population, this paper synthesizes research evidence regarding prevalent mental health issues as well as how minority stress may be linked to psychological health in Chinese MSM. RECENT FINDINGS: Results indicate that Chinese MSM experience a high prevalence of several mental health issues including depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviors, and alcohol dependence. SUMMARY: This review further reveals minority stress to be an important determinant of psychological distress among Chinese MSM, though evidence is mixed regarding the relationship between proximal minority stress and psychological health. Nonetheless, there is a lack of mental health services and interventions focusing on MSM in China. Culturally relevant, competent, and LGBT-affirmative mental health interventions are needed for Chinese MSM. To guide future intervention research, we provide considerations for reducing minority stress and promoting psychological health among Chinese MSM.",2020-01-16,"Sun, Shufang; Pachankis, John E.; Li, Xiaoming; Operario, Don",Curr HIV/AIDS Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/15ff2199944b730b208d063dcb720843dea5314a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7050812.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7050812/,

Targeting vectors pseudotyped with distinct viral envelope proteins that influence cell tropism and transfection efficiency are useful tools not only for examining entry mechanisms or cell tropisms but also for vaccine vector development. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is an excellent candidate for development as a pseudotype vector. A recombinant VSV lacking its own envelope (G) gene has been used to produce a pseudotype or recombinant VSV possessing the envelope proteins of heterologous viruses. These viruses possess a reporter gene instead of a VSV G gene in their genome, and therefore it is easy to evaluate their infectivity in the study of viral entry, including identification of viral receptors. Furthermore, advantage can be taken of a property of the pseudotype VSV, which is competence for single-round infection, in handling many different viruses that are either difficult to amplify in cultured cells or animals or that require specialized containment facilities.

We demonstrate that chicken tracheal ciliated cells express α2,3-linked SA, while goblet cells mainly express α2,6-linked SA. In addition, the plant lectin MAL-II, but not MAA/MAL-I, is bound to the surface of goblet cells, suggesting that SA2,3-linked oligosaccharides with Galβ1–3GalNAc subterminal residues are specifically present on the goblet cells. Moreover, both α2,3- and α2,6-linked SAs are detected on single tracheal basal cells. At a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) avian influenza virus H6N1 is exclusively detected in the ciliated cells, suggesting that the ciliated cell is the major target cell of the H6N1 virus. At a MOI of 1, ciliated, goblet and basal cells are all permissive to the AIV infection.

Hence the extent of likely excess healthcare needs during this period must be fully considered. We will make use of the historical healthcare record in Taiwan during and after the 1918 influenza pandemic to ascertain the scope of potential excess healthcare burden during the post-pandemic period. METHODS: To establish the healthcare needs after the initial wave in 1918, the yearly healthcare records (hospitalizations, outpatients, etc.) in Taiwan during 1918-1920 are compared with the corresponding data from the adjacent ""baseline"" years of 1916, 1917, 1921, and 1922 to estimate the excess healthcare burden during the initial outbreak in 1918 and in the years immediately after. RESULTS: In 1918 the number of public hospital outpatients exceeded the yearly average of the baseline years by 20.11% (95% CI: 16.43, 25.90), and the number of hospitalizations exceeded the corresponding yearly average of the baseline years by 12.20% (10.59, 14.38), while the excess number of patients treated by the public medics was statistically significant at 32.21% (28.48, 39.82) more than the yearly average of the baseline years. For 1920, only the excess number of hospitalizations was statistically significant at 19.83% (95% CI: 17.21, 23.38) more than the yearly average of the baseline years. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable extra burden with significant loss of lives was reported in 1918 by both the public medics system and the public hospitals. In comparison, only a substantial number of excess hospitalizations in the public hospitals was reported in 1920, indicating that the population was relatively unprepared for the first wave in 1918 and did not fully utilize the public hospitals. Moreover, comparatively low mortality was reported by the public hospitals and the public medics during the second wave in 1920 even though significantly more patients were hospitalized, suggesting that there had been substantially less fatal illnesses among the hospitalized patients during the second wave.

Here, we validate various scores supposed to predict mortality and develop an optimized categorical model. METHODS: In a derivation cohort, 108 ARDS patients (2010–2015) on veno-venous ECMO were retrospectively analysed to assess four established risk scores (ECMOnet-Score, RESP-Score, PRESERVE-Score, Roch-Score) for mortality prediction (receiver operating characteristic analysis) and to identify by multivariable logistic regression analysis independent variables for mortality to yield the new PRESET-Score (PREdiction of Survival on ECMO Therapy-Score). This new score was then validated both in independent internal (n = 82) and external (n = 59) cohorts. RESULTS: The median (25%; 75% quartile) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 14 (12; 16), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II was 62.5 (57; 72.8), median intensive care unit stay was 17 days (range 1–124), and mortality was 62%. Only the ECMOnet-Score (area under curve (AUC) 0.69) and the RESP-Score (AUC 0.64) discriminated survivors and non-survivors. Admission pH(a), mean arterial pressure, lactate, platelet concentrations, and pre-ECMO hospital stay were independent predictors of death and were used to build the PRESET-Score. The score’s internal (AUC 0.845; 95% CI 0.76–0.93; p < 0.001) and external (AUC 0.70; 95% CI 0.56–0.84; p = 0.008) validation revealed excellent discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: While our data confirm that both the ECMOnet-Score and the RESP-Score predict mortality in ECMO-treated ARDS patients, we propose a novel model also incorporating extrapulmonary variables, the PRESET-Score. This score predicts mortality much better than previous scores and therefore is a more precise choice for decision support in ARDS patients to be placed on ECMO.",2017-12-12,"Hilder, Michael; Herbstreit, Frank; Adamzik, Michael; Beiderlinden, Martin; Bürschen, Markus; Peters, Jürgen; Frey, Ulrich H.",Crit Care,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4d69c6ce8184ae8b05cb2be5818e26c2f4f02178.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5728043.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5728043/,

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) has been identified as an enzyme associated with immunoregulatory function. Although the regulatory role of IDO in viral replication has been postulated, the in vivo role of IDO activity has not been fully addressed in neurotropic virus-caused encephalitis. METHODS: Mice in which IDO activity was inhibited by genetic ablation or using a specific inhibitor were examined for mortality and clinical signs after infection. Neuroinflammation was evaluated by central nervous system (CNS) infiltration of leukocytes and cytokine expression. IDO expression, viral burden, JEV-specific T-cell, and type I/II interferon (IFN-I/II) innate responses were also analyzed. RESULTS: Elevated expression of IDO activity in myeloid and neuron cells of the lymphoid and CNS tissues was closely associated with clinical signs of JE. Furthermore, inhibition of IDO activity enhanced resistance to JE, reduced the viral burden in lymphoid and CNS tissues, and resulted in early and increased CNS infiltration by Ly-6C(hi) monocytes, NK, CD4(+), and CD8(+) T-cells. JE amelioration in IDO-ablated mice was also associated with enhanced NK and JEV-specific T-cell responses. More interestingly, IDO ablation induced rapid enhancement of type I IFN (IFN-I) innate responses in CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DCs), including conventional and plasmacytoid DCs, following JEV infection. This enhanced IFN-I innate response in IDO-ablated CD11c(+) DCs was coupled with strong induction of PRRs (RIG-I, MDA5), transcription factors (IRF7, STAT1), and antiviral ISG genes (Mx1, Mx2, ISG49, ISG54, ISG56). IDO ablation also enhanced the IFN-I innate response in neuron cells, which may delay the spread of virus in the CNS. Finally, we identified that IDO ablation in myeloid cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) dominantly contributed to JE amelioration and that HSC-derived leukocytes played a key role in the enhanced IFN-I innate responses in the IDO-ablated environment. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of IDO activity ameliorated JE via enhancement of antiviral IFN-I/II innate and adaptive T-cell responses and increased CNS infiltration of peripheral leukocytes. Therefore, our data provide valuable insight into the use of IDO inhibition by specific inhibitors as a promising tool for therapeutic and prophylactic strategies against viral encephalitis caused by neurotropic viruses.",2016-04-18,"Kim, Seong Bum; Choi, Jin Young; Uyangaa, Erdenebileg; Patil, Ajit Mahadev; Hossain, Ferdaus Mohd Altaf; Hur, Jin; Park, Sang-Youel; Lee, John-Hwa; Kim, Koanhoi; Eo, Seong Kug",J Neuroinflammation,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/213fdedff656134ff3dbe24a7d7bbba61d13baa1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4835894.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4835894/,

This study observed the expression of plasma sCD138, a soluble component shedding from the glycocalyx (GCX) to the circulating blood, and evaluated its predictive value on disease severity and prognosis of HFRS. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-six patients with HFRS who were treated at our center between January 2011 and December 2013 were randomly enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into a mild-type group, a moderate-type group, a severe-type group and a critical-type group according to the HFRS criteria for clinical classification. Thirty-five blood samples from healthy subjects were obtained as the controls. The concentrations of sCD138 were detected using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (Fib), albumin (ALB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), glucose (GLU), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) in the samples were routinely tested. The levels of sCD138 among the different types were compared; the correlation among sCD138 and the laboratory parameters mentioned above were analyzed. The predictive effectiveness for prognosis of sCD138 was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Except for the mild-type, the levels of sCD138 in the moderate-, severe- and critical-type patients during the acute stage were significantly higher than that of the convalescent stage and the control (P<0.05). With the aggravation of the disease, the levels of sCD138 during the acute stage had an increasing tendency, while demonstrated no significant difference among the moderate-, severe- and critical-type patients (P>0.05). sCD138 was negatively correlated with Fib, PLT and ALB, and was positively correlated with WBC and AST (P<0.05). sCD138 demonstrated predictive effectiveness for prognosis with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.778 (P<0.001).

Increasing evidence accumulated in the last decade has shown, however, that ROS (and redox signals) functionally regulate different cellular pathways in the host-pathogen interaction. These especially affect (i) pathogen entry through protein redox switches and redox modification (i.e., intra- and interdisulfide and cysteine oxidation) and (ii) phagocytic ROS production via Nox family NADPH oxidase enzyme and the control of phagolysosome function with key implications for antigen processing. The protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family of redox chaperones is closely involved in both processes and is also implicated in protein unfolding and trafficking across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and towards the cytosol, a thiol-based redox locus for antigen processing. Here, we summarise examples of the cellular association of host PDI with different pathogens and explore the possible roles of pathogen PDIs in infection.

One of the primary organs affected by sepsis is the lung, presenting as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Organ damage in sepsis involves an alteration in gene expression, making gene transfer a potential therapeutic modality. This work examines the feasibility of applying simian virus 40 (SV40) vectors for pulmonary gene therapy. METHODS: Sepsis-induced ARDS was established by cecal ligation double puncture (2CLP). SV40 vectors carrying the luciferase reporter gene (SV/luc) were administered intratracheally immediately after sepsis induction. Sham operated (SO) as well as 2CLP rats given intratracheal PBS or adenovirus expressing luciferase served as controls. Luc transduction was evaluated by in vivo light detection, immunoassay and luciferase mRNA detection by RT-PCR in tissue harvested from septic rats. Vector abundance and distribution into alveolar cells was evaluated using immunostaining for the SV40 VP1 capsid protein as well as by double staining for VP1 and for the surfactant protein C (proSP-C). Immunostaining for T-lymphocytes was used to evaluate the cellular immune response induced by the vector. RESULTS: Luc expression measured by in vivo light detection correlated with immunoassay from lung tissue harvested from the same rats. Moreover, our results showed vector presence in type II alveolar cells. The vector did not induce significant cellular immune response.

Maximal frameshifting was observed with oligonucleotides of 12–18 nt. Antisense oligonucleotides bearing locked nucleid acid (LNA) modifications also proved to be efficient frameshift-stimulators in contrast to DNA oligonucleotides. The number, sequence and location of LNA bases in an otherwise DNA oligonucleotide have to be carefully manipulated to obtain optimal levels of frameshifting.

We have previously demonstrated in the MIA mouse model that maternal administration of H(2) attenuates oxidative damage and neuroinflammation, including induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglial activation, in the fetal brain. Short-term memory, sociability and social novelty, and sensorimotor gating were evaluated using the Y-maze, three-chamber, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) tests, respectively, at postnatal 3 or 4 weeks. The number of neurons and oligodendrocytes was also analyzed at postnatal 5 weeks by immunohistochemical analysis. Offspring of the LPS-exposed dams showed deficits in short-term memory and social interaction, following neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss in the amygdala and cortex. Maternal H(2) administration markedly attenuated these LPS-induced abnormalities. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of H(2) on LPS-induced astrocytic activation, both in vivo and in vitro. The number of activated astrocytes with hypertrophic morphology was increased in LPS-exposed offspring, but decreased in the offspring of H(2)-administered dams. In primary cultured astrocytes, LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines were attenuated by H(2) administration.

Animal models help to understand the complex interplay between the different cell types of the CNS and uncover general mechanisms of damage and repair of myelin sheaths. The so called cuprizone model is a toxic model of demyelination in the CNS white and gray matter, which lacks an autoimmune component. Cuprizone induces apoptosis of mature oligodendrocytes that leads to a robust demyelination and profound activation of both astrocytes and microglia with regional heterogeneity between different white and gray matter regions. Although not suitable to study autoimmune mediated demyelination, this model is extremely helpful to elucidate basic cellular and molecular mechanisms during de- and particularly remyelination independently of interactions with peripheral immune cells. Phagocytosis and removal of damaged myelin seems to be one of the major roles of microglia in this model and it is well known that removal of myelin debris is a prerequisite of successful remyelination. Furthermore, microglia provide several signals that support remyelination. The role of astrocytes during de- and remyelination is not well defined. Both supportive and destructive functions have been suggested. Using the cuprizone model we could demonstrate that there is an important crosstalk between astrocytes and microglia. In this review we focus on the role of glial reactions and interaction in the cuprizone model.

Several chemotypes of small molecules, including heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) and sulfamoylbenzamides (SBAs), have been discovered to allosterically modulate core protein structure and consequentially alter the kinetics and pathway of core protein assembly, resulting in formation of irregularly-shaped core protein aggregates or “empty” capsids devoid of pre-genomic RNA and viral DNA polymerase. Interestingly, in addition to inhibiting nucleocapsid assembly and subsequent viral genome replication, we have now demonstrated that HAPs and SBAs differentially modulate the biosynthesis of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA from de novo infection and intracellular amplification pathways by inducing disassembly of nucleocapsids derived from virions as well as double-stranded DNA-containing progeny nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm. Specifically, the mistimed cuing of nucleocapsid uncoating prevents cccDNA formation during de novo infection of hepatocytes, while transiently accelerating cccDNA synthesis from cytoplasmic progeny nucleocapsids. Our studies indicate that elongation of positive-stranded DNA induces structural changes of nucleocapsids, which confers ability of mature nucleocapsids to bind CpAMs and triggers its disassembly.

Although HTLV-2 is not usually pathogenic, it is widely distributed among native Indian populations in Brazil, particularly in the Amazon region of the country. Presently, HTLV spreads mainly by the sexual route and from mother to child, and virus persistence is an active biological factor aiding its transmission. Recently, the use of illicit drugs has been shown to be an additional risk factor, showing the influence of new habits on the epidemiology of HTLV in the region. Despite the detection of the virus in several different populations in the Amazon region of Brazil for almost 30 years, the exact prevalence of HTLV-1/2 is not well defined. The original biases in sampling and the selection of epidemiologically unsuitable populations were commonly repeated in most prevalence studies, generating unreliable and conflicting figures that do not represent the actual prevalence of HTLV. The improvements in clinical and laboratory facilities have resulted in the description of several clinical manifestations that were previously unknown in the region. The extent of the spread of the virus must be defined in this region, which is the largest geographical area of the country.

Although targeting radio-resistant cancer cells is important for improving the treatmental efficiency, the signaling pathway- and therapeutic strategy-related to laryngeal carcinoma still require further study. Galangin is an active pharmacological ingredient, isolated from propolis and Alpinia officinarum Hance, and has been reported to have anticancer and anti-oxidative properties through regulation of cell cycle, resulting in angiogenesis, apoptosis, invasion and migration without triggering any toxicity in normal cells. PI3K/AKT and p38 are important signaling pathways to modulate cancer cell apoptosis and proliferation through caspase-3, NF-κB and mTOR signal pathways. Autophagy is also enhanced by activating LC3s and Beclin 1. In the present study, galangin was found to suppress laryngeal cancer cell proliferation. Also, flow cytometry, immunohistochemical and western blot analysis indicated that cell apoptosis was induced for galangin administration, promoting caspase-3 expression through regulating PI3K/AKT/NF-κB. Furthermore, galangin inhibited laryngeal cancer cell proliferation, related to p38 inactivation by galangin treatment. Additionally, mTOR activation regulated by PI3K/AKT was reduced by galangin, suppressing cancer cell transcription and proliferation. Our data also indicated that the tumor volume and weight in nude mice were reduced for galangin use in vivo accompanied by Ki-67 decrease and TUNEL increase in tumor tissues. Together, our data indicated that galangin has a potential role in suppressing human laryngeal cancer via inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, activating apoptosis and autophagy, which were regulated by p38 and AKT/NF-κB/mTOR pathways, providing a therapeutic strategy for human laryngeal cancer treatment.",2017-06-29,"Wang, Hai-Xu; Tang, Chen",Oncol Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/073f69cb524332da71737facd889ffefd4aafa46.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5562077.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5562077/,

Individual antibodies only partially neutralize GM-CSF activity using an in vitro bioassay, depending on the experimental conditions, while, when injected in mice together with human GM-CSF, they lead to the accumulation of a large pool of circulating GM-CSF that remains partially bioavailable.

Multiple exon skipping, which is theoretically applicable to 80–90% of DMD patients in total, have been demonstrated in animal models, including dystrophic mice and dogs, using cocktail antisense oligonucleotides (AOs). Although promising, current drug approval systems pose challenges for the use of a cocktail AO. For example, both exons 6 and 8 need to be skipped to restore the reading frame in dystrophic dogs. Therefore, the cocktail of AOs targeting these exons has a combined therapeutic effect and each AO does not have a therapeutic effect by itself.

Methods We reviewed all studies presenting estimates of the serial interval or generation time and the reproduction number of the A/H1N1 (2009) virus infection. Results Thirteen studies documented the serial interval from household or close‐contact studies, with overall mean 3 days (95% CI: 2·4, 3·6); taking into account tertiary transmission reduced this estimate to 2·6 days. Model‐based estimates were more variable, from 1·9 to 6 days. Twenty‐four studies reported reproduction numbers for community‐based epidemics at the town or country level. The range was 1·2–3·1, with larger estimates reported at the beginning of the pandemic. Accounting for under‐reporting in the early period of the pandemic and limiting variation because of the choice of the generation time interval, the reproduction number was between 1·2 and 2·3 with median 1·5. Discussion The serial interval of A/H1N1 (2009) flu was typically short, with mean value similar to the seasonal flu. The estimates of the reproduction number were more variable.

It quickly became an issue of great public concern and a widely discussed topic on the Internet. A considerable volume of relevant information was made publicly available on the Internet through various sources. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the outbreak of H7N9 in China based on data openly available on the Internet and to validate our investigation by comparing our findings with a well-conducted conventional field epidemiologic study. METHODS: We searched publicly accessible Internet data on the H7N9 outbreak primarily from government and major mass media websites in China up to February 10, 2014. Two researchers independently extracted, compared, and confirmed the information of each confirmed H7N9 case using a self-designed data extraction form. We summarized the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of confirmed H7N9 cases and compared them with those from the field study. RESULTS: According to our data updated until February 10, 2014, 334 confirmed H7N9 cases were identified. The median age was 58 years and 67.0% (219/327) were males. Cases were reported in 15 regions in China. Five family clusters were found. Of the 16.8% (56/334) of the cases with relevant data, 69.6% (39/56) reported a history of exposure to animals. Of the 1751 persons with a close contact with a confirmed case, 0.6% (11/1751) of them developed respiratory symptoms during the 7-day surveillance period. In the 97.9% (327/334) of the cases with relevant data, 21.7% (71/327) died, 20.8% (68/327) were discharged from a hospital, and 57.5% (188/327) were of uncertain status. We compared our findings before February 10, 2014 and those before December 1, 2013 with those from the conventional field study, which had the latter cutoff date of ours in data collection. Our study showed most epidemiological and clinical characteristics were similar to those in the field study, except for case fatality (71/327, 21.7% for our data before February 10; 45/138, 32.6% for our data before December 1; 47/139, 33.8% for the field study), time from illness onset to first medical care (4 days, 3 days, and 1 day), and time from illness onset to death (16.5 days, 17 days, and 21 days). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from our Internet-based investigation were similar to those from the conventional field study in most epidemiological and clinical aspects of the outbreak. Importantly, publicly available Internet data are open to any interested researchers and can thus greatly facilitate the investigation and control of such outbreaks. With improved efforts for Internet data provision, Internet-based investigation has a great potential to become a quick, economical, novel approach to investigating sudden issues of great public concern that involve a relatively small number of cases like this H7N9 outbreak.",2014-09-25,"Mao, Chen; Wu, Xin-Yin; Fu, Xiao-Hong; Di, Meng-Yang; Yu, Yuan-Yuan; Yuan, Jin-Qiu; Yang, Zu-Yao; Tang, Jin-Ling",J Med Internet Res,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4211021.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211021/,

Many protozoan parasites have evolved a cyst lifecycle stage that provides it with increased protection from environmental degradation as well as endogenous host mechanisms of attack.

Currently, little is known about the nature of the immune response stimulated by the presence of these cysts or how they are able to propagate. Here we establish a novel chitinase-dependent mechanism of cyst control in the infected brain. Despite a dominant Th1 immune response during Toxoplasma infection there exists a population of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMØ) in the infected CNS. These cells are capable of cyst lysis via the production of AMCase as revealed by live imaging, and this chitinase is necessary for protective immunity within the CNS.

The former recognized a denaturation-insensitive epitope within the p24 protein whereas the latter recognized a denaturation-sensitive, conformational epitope located within the HBsAg common “a” determinant. This mAb, denominated ADRI-2F3, displayed a very high protective titer of over 43,000 IU/mg mAb and showed an extremely potent neutralizing activity in the in vitro model of HBV infection using primary hepatocytes from Tupaia belangeri as target. Recombinant variable heavy and light domain sequences derived from mAb ADRI-2F3 were cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors and showed identical fine specificity and 1 log(10) higher titer than the original IgG1λ.

Some of these include adjusting for individual follow-up time, repeated measurements of multiple outcomes and missing data among others. Furthermore, pre-specifying appropriate analysis becomes difficult as some safety endpoints are unexpected. Although existing guidelines such as CONSORT encourage thorough reporting of adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials, they provide limited details for safety data analysis. The limited guidelines may influence suboptimal analysis by failing to account for some analysis challenges above. A typical example where such challenges exist are trials of anti-malarial drugs for malaria prevention during pregnancy. Lack of proper standardized evaluation of the safety of antimalarial drugs has limited the ability to draw conclusions about safety. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to establish the current practice in statistical analysis for preventive antimalarial drug safety in pregnancy. METHODS: The search included five databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Malaria in Pregnancy Library and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) to identify original English articles reporting Phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on anti-malarial drugs for malaria prevention in pregnancy published from January 2010 to July 2019. RESULTS: Eighteen trials were included in this review that collected multiple longitudinal safety outcomes including AEs. Statistical analysis and reporting of the safety outcomes in all the trials used descriptive statistics; proportions/counts (n = 18, 100%) and mean/median (n = 2, 11.1%). Results presentation included tabular (n = 16, 88.9%) and text description (n = 2, 11.1%). Univariate inferential methods were reported in most trials (n = 16, 88.9%); including Chi square/Fisher’s exact test (n = 12, 66.7%), t test (n = 2, 11.1%) and Mann–Whitney/Wilcoxon test (n = 1, 5.6%). Multivariable methods, including Poisson and negative binomial were reported in few trials (n = 3, 16.7%). Assessment of a potential link between missing efficacy data and safety outcomes was not reported in any of the trials that reported efficacy missing data (n = 7, 38.9%). CONCLUSION: The review demonstrated that statistical analysis of safety data in anti-malarial drugs for malarial chemoprevention in pregnancy RCTs is inadequate. The analyses insufficiently account for multiple safety outcomes potential dependence, follow-up time and informative missing data which can compromise anti-malarial drug safety evidence development, based on the available data.",2020-03-20,"Patson, Noel; Mukaka, Mavuto; Otwombe, Kennedy N.; Kazembe, Lawrence; Mathanga, Don P.; Mwapasa, Victor; Kabaghe, Alinune N.; Eijkemans, Marinus J.

Liberated attenuator RNAs arising in this process are generally considered nonfunctional. In Sinorhizobium meliloti, the tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis genes are organized into three operons, trpE(G), ppiD-trpDC-moaC-moeA, and trpFBA-accD-folC, of which only the first one, trpE(G), contains a short ORF (trpL) in the 5′-UTR and is regulated by transcription attenuation. Under conditions of Trp sufficiency, transcription is terminated between trpL and trpE(G), and a small attenuator RNA, rnTrpL, is produced. Here, we show that rnTrpL base-pairs with trpD and destabilizes the polycistronic trpDC mRNA, indicating rnTrpL-mediated downregulation of the trpDC operon in trans. Although all three trp operons are regulated in response to Trp availability, only in the two operons trpE(G) and trpDC the Trp-mediated regulation is controlled by rnTrpL. Together, our data show that the trp attenuator coordinates trpE(G) and trpDC expression posttranscriptionally by two fundamentally different mechanisms: ribosome-mediated transcription attenuation in cis and base-pairing in trans. Also, we present evidence that rnTrpL-mediated regulation of trpDC genes expression in trans is conserved in Agrobacterium and Bradyrhizobium, suggesting that the small attenuator RNAs may have additional conserved functions in the control of bacterial gene expression.",2019-07-09,"Melior, Hendrik; Li, Siqi; Madhugiri, Ramakanth; Stötzel, Maximilian; Azarderakhsh, Saina; Barth-Weber, Susanne; Baumgardt, Kathrin; Ziebuhr, John; Evguenieva-Hackenberg, Elena",Nucleic Acids Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6c51eafc88ddf46d27452c1a1b7a009c5341e848.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6614838.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6614838/,

The 190 kb GpSGHV genome contains 160 open reading frames and encodes more than 60 confirmed proteins. The asymptomatic GpSGHV infection in flies can convert to symptomatic infection that is characterized by overt salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH). Flies with SGH show reduced general fitness and reproductive dysfunction. Although the occurrence of SGH is an exception rather than the rule, G. pallidipes is thought to be the most susceptible to expression of overt SGH symptoms compared to other Glossina species that are largely asymptomatic. Although Glossina salivary glands (SGs) play an essential role in GpSGHV transmission, the functions of the salivary components during the virus infection are poorly understood. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to study SG proteomes of G. pallidipes and G. m. morsitans, two Glossina model species that exhibit differential GpSGHV pathologies (high and low incidence of SGH, respectively). A total of 540 host proteins were identified, of which 23 and 9 proteins were significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively, in G. pallidipes compared to G. m. morsitans. Whereas 58 GpSGHV proteins were detected in G. pallidipes F(1) progenies, only 5 viral proteins were detected in G. m. morsitans. Unlike in G. pallidipes, qPCR assay did not show any significant increase in virus titers in G. m. morsitans F(1) progenies, confirming that G. m. morsitans is less susceptible to GpSGHV infection and replication compared to G. pallidipes. Based on our results, we speculate that in the case of G. pallidipes, GpSGHV employs a repertoire of host intracellular signaling pathways for successful infection. In the case of G. m. morsitans, antiviral responses appeared to be dominant.

A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. We show for the first time that far-UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses, with a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm(2) of 222-nm light inactivating >95% of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus.

The mechanism of PM-mediated pathophysiology remains unknown. However, PM is proinflammatory to the endothelium and increases vascular permeability in vitro and in vivo via ROS generation. OBJECTIVES: We explored the role of tight junction proteins as targets for PM-induced loss of lung endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity and enhanced cardiopulmonary dysfunction. METHODS: Changes in human lung EC monolayer permeability were assessed by Transendothelial Electrical Resistance (TER) in response to PM challenge (collected from Ft. McHenry Tunnel, Baltimore, MD, particle size >0.1 μm). Biochemical assessment of ROS generation and Ca(2+) mobilization were also measured. RESULTS: PM exposure induced tight junction protein Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) relocation from the cell periphery, which was accompanied by significant reductions in ZO-1 protein levels but not in adherens junction proteins (VE-cadherin and β-catenin). N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC, 5 mM) reduced PM-induced ROS generation in ECs, which further prevented TER decreases and atteneuated ZO-1 degradation. PM also mediated intracellular calcium mobilization via the transient receptor potential cation channel M2 (TRPM2), in a ROS-dependent manner with subsequent activation of the Ca(2+)-dependent protease calpain. PM-activated calpain is responsible for ZO-1 degradation and EC barrier disruption. Overexpression of ZO-1 attenuated PM-induced endothelial barrier disruption and vascular hyperpermeability in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that PM induces marked increases in vascular permeability via ROS-mediated calcium leakage via activated TRPM2, and via ZO-1 degradation by activated calpain.

While the CC lines are phenotypically diverse, their genetic diversity in drug disposition processes, such as detoxification reactions, is still largely uncharacterized. Here we systematically measured RNA-sequencing expression profiles from livers of 29 CC lines under baseline conditions. We then leveraged a reference collection of metabolic biotransformation pathways to map potential relations between drugs and their underlying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). By applying this approach on proximal eQTLs, including eQTLs acting on the overall expression of genes and on the expression of particular transcript isoforms, we were able to construct the organization of hepatic eQTL-drug connectivity across the CC population. The analysis revealed a substantial impact of genetic variation acting on drug biotransformation, allowed mapping of potential joint genetic effects in the context of individual drugs, and demonstrated crosstalk between drug metabolism and lipid metabolism.

We applied IL-XPCI to observe the lungs in an intact mouse for the purpose of defining quantitatively the micro-structures in lung. FINDINGS: The three-dimensional model of the lung was successfully established, which provided an excellent view of lung airways. We highlighted the use of IL-XPCI in the visualization and assessment of alveoli which had rarely been studied in three dimensions (3D). The precise view of individual alveolus was achieved. The morphological parameters, such as diameter and alveolar surface area were measured. These parameters were of great importance in the diagnosis of diseases related to alveolus and alveolar scar.

Important research questions concern the involvement of the host innate immune response in pathogenesis, key to which is the role played by microglia, resident macrophages of the brain parenchyma. Do microglia have a protective function, by coordinating the innate immune response to viral infection, or do they drive pathogenic neuroinflammation? Here we synthesize recent data from mouse models of acute viral encephalitis, which reveal an unambiguously protective role for microglia. Depletion of microglia, via blockade of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling, led to increased viral replication accompanied by more severe neurological disease and heightened mortality. Whilst the underlying mechanism(s) remain to be defined, microglial interactions with T cells and phagocytosis of infected neurones appear to play a role. Paradoxically, the production of inflammatory cytokines was increased in several instances following viral infection in microglia-depleted brains, suggesting that: (i) cells other than microglia mediate inflammatory responses and/or (ii) microglia may exert a regulatory function. Under certain circumstances the microglial antiviral response might contribute negatively to longer-term neurological sequelae, although fewer studies have focused on this aspect in encephalitis models. Understanding regulation of the microglial response, and how it contributes to disease is therefore a priority for future studies. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the central role of microglia in pathogenesis, suggesting the exciting possibility that defects of microglial function might contribute to encephalitis susceptibility and/or outcome in humans.",2019-11-13,"Hatton, Catherine F.; Duncan, Christopher J.

One of the only treatments is supportive: mechanical ventilation. However, improperly set mechanical ventilation can further increase the risk of death in patients with ARDS. Recent studies suggest that ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) is caused by exaggerated regional lung strain, particularly in areas of alveolar instability subject to tidal recruitment/derecruitment and stress-multiplication. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that if a ventilation strategy can maintain stable lung inflation and homogeneity, regional dynamic strain would be reduced and VILI attenuated. A time-controlled adaptive ventilation (TCAV) method was developed to minimize dynamic alveolar strain by adjusting the delivered breath according to the mechanical characteristics of the lung. The goal of this review is to describe how the TCAV method impacts pathophysiology and protects lungs with, or at high risk of, acute lung injury. We present work from our group and others that identifies novel mechanisms of VILI in the alveolar microenvironment and demonstrates that the TCAV method can reduce VILI in translational animal ARDS models and mortality in surgical/trauma patients. Our TCAV method utilizes the airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode and is based on opening and collapsing time constants, which reflect the viscoelastic properties of the terminal airspaces. Time-controlled adaptive ventilation uses inspiratory and expiratory time to (1) gradually “nudge” alveoli and alveolar ducts open with an extended inspiratory duration and (2) prevent alveolar collapse using a brief (sub-second) expiratory duration that does not allow time for alveolar collapse.

Poxviridae are a large, diverse family of DNA viruses that can infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates. To date, only a few documented detections of poxviruses have been described in bat populations on three different continents (America, Africa, and Australia). These viruses are phylogenetically dissimilar and have diverse clinical impacts on their hosts. Herein, we report the isolation, nearly complete genome sequencing, and annotation of a novel poxvirus detected from an insectivorous bat (Hypsugo savii) in Northern Italy. The virus is tentatively named Hypsugopoxvirus (HYPV) after the bat species from which it was isolated. The nearly complete genome size is 166,600 nt and it encodes 161 genes. Genome analyses suggest that HYPV belongs to the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily, with the highest nucleotide identity (85%) to Eptesipoxvirus (EPTV) detected from a microbat Eptesicus fuscus in WA, USA, in 2011. To date, HYPV represents the first poxvirus detected in bats in Europe; thus, its viral ecology and disease associations should be investigated further.",2019-06-19,"Lelli, Davide; Lavazza, Antonio; Prosperi, Alice; Sozzi, Enrica; Faccin, Francesca; Baioni, Laura; Trogu, Tiziana; Cavallari, Gian Luca; Mauri, Matteo; Gibellini, Anna Maria; Chiapponi, Chiara; Moreno, Ana",Viruses,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3aeb4a0f6893b933dc061157d196e5618380c63b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6631891.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631891/,

Recent immunological research has focused on innate immunity as the first line of host defense, especially pattern recognition molecules such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Various microbial components are recognized by their vague and common molecular shapes so-called, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs induce inflammatory reactions mediated by the activation of the transcription factor, NF-κB, and by interferons, which lead to an antiviral immune response.

Wounded skin is one of the preferred niches for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has developed diverse strategies to impair tissue repair processes and promote infection. Here, we analyse the effect of the P. aeruginosa fucose-binding lectin LecB on human keratinocytes and demonstrate that it triggers events in the host, upon binding to fucosylated residues on cell membrane receptors, which extend beyond its role as an adhesion molecule. We found that LecB associates with insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and dampens its signalling, leading to the arrest of cell cycle. In addition, we describe a novel LecB-triggered mechanism to down-regulate host cell receptors by showing that LecB leads to insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor internalisation and subsequent missorting towards intracellular endosomal compartments, without receptor activation.

We hypothesized that this approach would result in more robust cellular immune responses than those achieved with the use of any of the vaccines alone in a homologous prime-boost regimen. To this end, we primed BALB/c mice with each of the NSV-based vectors. Primed mice were rested for thirty-five days after which we administered a second immunization with the same or heterologous NSV-Gag viruses. The magnitude and quality of the Gag-specific CD8(+) T cells in response to these vectors post boost were measured. In addition, we performed challenge experiments using vaccinia virus expressing HIV-1 Gag (VV-Gag) thirty-three days after the boost inoculation. Our results showed that the choice of the vaccine used for priming was important for the detected Gag-specific CD8(+) T cell recall responses post boost and that NDV-Gag appeared to result in a more robust recall of CD8(+) T cell responses independent of the prime vaccine used. However, the different prime-boost strategies were not distinct for the parameters studied in the challenge experiments using VV-Gag but did indicate some benefits compared to single immunizations. Taken together, our data show that NSV vectors can individually stimulate HIV-Gag specific CD8(+) T cells that are effectively recalled by other NSV vectors in a heterologous prime-boost approach. These results provide evidence that RABV, VSV and NDV can be used in combination to develop vaccines needing prime-boost regimens to stimulate effective immune responses.",2013-06-26,"Lawrence, Tessa M.; Wanjalla, Celestine N.; Gomme, Emily A.; Wirblich, Christoph; Gatt, Anthony; Carnero, Elena; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Lyles, Douglas S.; McGettigan, James P.; Schnell, Matthias J.",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/91ac78d2a3c677d322fc8b14bc23e6b4244b5bdc.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3694142.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694142/,

The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (A); MagNA Pure LC2.0 Automatic extractor (B); KingFisher (C); and NucliSENS EasyMag (D) RNA extraction systems were evaluated for extraction efficiency and co-purification of inhibitors from stool suspensions. Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) of MS-2 coliphage spiked into each system’s lysis buffer served as an external control for both. Cycle thresholds (Cts) of the MS2 were determined for RNA extracted from stool suspensions containing unknown (n = 93) or varying amounts of inhibitors (n = 92). Stool suspensions from the latter group were also used to determine whether MS-2 and enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibitions were correlated. Specifically 23 RNA extracts from stool suspensions were spiked with enterovirus RNA after extraction and 13 of these stool suspension were spiked with intact enterovirus before extraction. MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition varied for RNAs extracted by the different systems. Inhibition was noted in 12 (13.0%), 26 (28.3%), 7 (7.6%), and 7 (7.6%) of the first 93 RNA extracts, and 58 (63.0%), 55 (59.8%), 37 (40.2%) and 30 (32.6%) of the second 92 extracts for A, B, C, and D, respectively. Furthermore, enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibition correlated with MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition for added enterovirus RNA or virus particles.

However, these are typically confined to wealthy, developed countries; or, to the national reference laboratories of developing-world countries. There are many infectious diseases that are endemic in low-resource settings (LRS) where the lack of simple, instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to timely treatment. One of the primary barriers to the practicality and availability of NA assays in LRS has been the complexity and power requirements of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation (another is sample preparation). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays. We assess the heater's equivalence to commercially available PCR instruments through the characterization of the temperature profiles produced, and a minimal method comparison. Versions of the prototype for several different isothermal techniques are presented. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays, and that the results of those assays are not significantly different from ones incubated in parallel in commercially available PCR instruments. These results clearly suggest the potential of the non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heater for molecular diagnostics in LRS.

We hypothesize that thymocyte development is altered by infected thymic antigen presenting cells (TAPCs) in the fetal/neonatal thymus that interact with double-positive thymocytes causing an acute deficiency of T cells that produces “holes” in the T cell repertoire allowing for poor recognition of PRRSV and other neonatal pathogens. The deficiency may be the result of random elimination of PRRSV-specific T cells or the generation of T cells that accept PRRSV epitopes as self-antigens. Loss of helper T cells for virus neutralizing (VN) epitopes can result in the failure of selection for B cells in lymph node germinal centers capable of producing high affinity VN antibodies. Generation of cytotoxic and regulatory T cells may also be impaired. Similar to infections with LDV, LCMV, MCMV, HIV-1 and trypanosomes, the host responds to the deficiency of pathogen-specific T cells and perhaps regulatory T cells, by “last ditch” polyclonal B cell activation. In colostrum-deprived PRRSV-infected isolator piglets, this results in hypergammaglobulinemia, which we believe to be a “red herring” that detracts attention from the thymic atrophy story, but leads to our second independent hypothesis. Since hypergammaglobulinemia has not been reported in PRRSV-infected conventionally-reared piglets, we hypothesize that this is due to the down-regulatory effect of passive maternal IgG and cytokines in porcine colostrum, especially TGFβ which stimulates development of regulatory T cells (Tregs).",2019-05-15,"Butler, John E.; Sinkora, Marek; Wang, Gang; Stepanova, Katerina; Li, Yuming; Cai, Xuehui",Front Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/37cae647fffbd8ed2ba338d805a6029577621c1d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6529568.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6529568/,

Although numerous advances have been made, its representative molecular signatures remain largely unknown, especially the role of genes in HF progression. The aim of the present prospective follow-up study was to reveal potential biomarkers associated with the progression of heart failure. METHODS: We generated multi-level transcriptomic data from a cohort of left ventricular heart tissue collected from 21 HF patients and 9 healthy donors. By using Masson staining to calculate the fibrosis percentage for each sample, we applied lasso regression model to identify the genes associated with fibrosis as well as progression. The genes were further validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in the same cohort and qRT-PCR using another independent cohort (20 HF and 9 healthy donors). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the plasma level in a validation cohort (139 HF patients) for predicting HF progression. RESULTS: Based on the multi-level transcriptomic data, we examined differentially expressed genes [mRNAs, microRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)] in the study cohort.

Overexpression of USP25 inhibited virus-induced activation of IFN-β, interferon regulation factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), as well as the phosphorylation of IRF3 and NF-κB subunit p65. Furthermore, Knockdown of USP25 potentiated virus-induced induction of the IFN-β. In addition, detailed analysis demonstrated that USP25 cleaved lysine 48- and lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains in vitro and in vivo, and its deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activity, were dependent on a cysteine residue (Cys178) and a histidine residue (His607).

Chickens of a commercial egg-laying line were infected with a lentogenic strain of NDV (Newcastle disease virus); half the birds were maintained at thermoneutral temperature and the other half were exposed to high ambient temperature before the NDV challenge and throughout the remainder of the study. Phenotypic responses to heat, to NDV, or to heat + NDV were measured. Selected SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) within 14 target genes or regions were genotyped; and genotype effects on phenotypic responses to NDV or heat + NDV were tested in each individual treatment group and the combined groups. Seventeen significant haplotype effects, among seven genes and seven phenotypes, were detected for response to NDV or heat or NDV + heat.

Dissecting the genetic architecture underlying these variations will facilitate the search for key role candidate genes involved directly in the hepatomegaly process and indirectly involved in related diseases etiology. METHODS: Liver weight of 506 mice generated from 39 different Collaborative Cross (CC) lines with both sexes at age 20 weeks old was determined using an electronic balance. Genomic DNA of the CC lines was genotyped with high‐density single nucleotide polymorphic markers. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed a significant (P < 0.05) variation of liver weight between the CC lines, with broad sense heritability (H (2)) of 0.32 and genetic coefficient of variation (CV(G)) of 0.28. Subsequently, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was performed, and results showed a significant QTL only for females on chromosome 8 at genomic interval 88.61‐93.38 Mb (4.77 Mb). Three suggestive QTL were mapped at chromosomes 4, 12 and 13. The four QTL were designated as LWL1‐LWL4 referring to liver weight loci 1‐4 on chromosomes 8, 4, 12 and 13, respectively. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this report presents, for the first time, the utilization of the CC for mapping QTL associated with baseline liver weight in mice.

However, the relative contribution of memory CD8 T cells in providing protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is currently unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we utilized a prime-boost immunization approach to induce robust memory CD8 T cell responses in the absence of RSV-specific CD4 T cells and antibodies. Unexpectedly, RSV infection of mice with pre-existing CD8 T cell memory led to exacerbated weight loss, pulmonary disease, and lethal immunopathology. The exacerbated disease in immunized mice was not epitope-dependent and occurred despite a significant reduction in RSV viral titers. In addition, the lethal immunopathology was unique to the context of an RSV infection as mice were protected from a normally lethal challenge with a recombinant influenza virus expressing an RSV epitope. Memory CD8 T cells rapidly produced IFN-γ following RSV infection resulting in elevated protein levels in the lung and periphery. Neutralization of IFN-γ in the respiratory tract reduced morbidity and prevented mortality. These results demonstrate that in contrast to other respiratory viruses, RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells can induce lethal immunopathology despite mediating enhanced viral clearance.",2018-01-02,"Schmidt, Megan E.; Knudson, Cory J.; Hartwig, Stacey M.; Pewe, Lecia L.; Meyerholz, David K.; Langlois, Ryan A.; Harty, John T.; Varga, Steven M.",PLoS Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/87ea5f33f033c465a124321613ad36f96a560eba.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5766251.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5766251/,

Although in total 16 high-risk HPV strains have been identified so far.

Because of the high level of antigenic specificity of HPV capsid antigens, the currently available vaccines are not suitable to provide cross-protection from all other high-risk HPV strains. Due to increasing reports of cervical cancer cases from other HPV high-risk strains other than HPV16 and 18, it is crucial to design vaccine that generate reasonable CD8+ T-cell responses for possibly all the high-risk strains. With this aim, we have developed a computational workflow to identify conserved cross-clade CD8+ T-cell HPV vaccine candidates by considering E1, E2, E6 and E7 proteins from all the high-risk HPV strains.

METHODS: This study was conducted to determine the effects of ethyl acetate (45 L Ea), ethanol (45 L Et), and hexane (45 L H) leaf extracts of G. parvifolia on the infectivity of pseudorabies virus (PrV) in Vero cells. The antiviral effects of the extracts were determined by cytopathic effect (CPE), inhibition, attachment, and virucidal assays.

However, drug design targeting IDPs is still in the very early stages. Progress in drug design is usually achieved using experimental screening; however, the structural disorder of IDPs makes it difficult to characterize their interaction with ligands using experiments alone. To better understand the structure of IDPs and their interactions with small molecule ligands, we performed extensive simulations on the c-Myc(370–409) peptide and its binding to a reported small molecule inhibitor, ligand 10074-A4. We found that the conformational space of the apo c-Myc(370–409) peptide was rather dispersed and that the conformations of the peptide were stabilized mainly by charge interactions and hydrogen bonds. Under the binding of the ligand, c-Myc(370–409) remained disordered. The ligand was found to bind to c-Myc(370–409) at different sites along the chain and behaved like a ‘ligand cloud’. In contrast to ligand binding to more rigid target proteins that usually results in a dominant bound structure, ligand binding to IDPs may better be described as ligand clouds around protein clouds. Nevertheless, the binding of the ligand and a non-ligand to the c-Myc(370–409) target could be clearly distinguished.

Diagnostic tests using conventional assays that appear to be negative, even when undertaken late in the disease and despite the clinical diagnosis, have a tendency, at times, to be unreliable. These tests are rarely optimal and entirely dependent on the nature and quality of the sample supplied. In the course of the past three decades, the application of molecular biology has aided in the development of tests that result in a more rapid detection of rabies virus. These tests enable viral strain identification from clinical specimens. Currently, there are a number of molecular tests that can be used to complement conventional tests in rabies diagnosis. Indeed the challenges in the 21st century for the development of rabies diagnostics are not of a technical nature; these tests are available now. The challenges in the 21st century for diagnostic test developers are two-fold: firstly, to achieve internationally accepted validation of a test that will then lead to its acceptance by organisations globally. Secondly, the areas of the world where such tests are needed are mainly in developing regions where financial and logistical barriers prevent their implementation. Although developing countries with a poor healthcare infrastructure recognise that molecular-based diagnostic assays will be unaffordable for routine use, the cost/benefit ratio should still be measured. Adoption of rapid and affordable rabies diagnostic tests for use in developing countries highlights the importance of sharing and transferring technology through laboratory twinning between the developed and the developing countries. Importantly for developing countries, the benefit of molecular methods as tools is the capability for a differential diagnosis of human diseases that present with similar clinical symptoms. Antemortem testing for human rabies is now possible using molecular techniques. These barriers are not insurmountable and it is our expectation that if such tests are accepted and implemented where they are most needed, they will provide substantial improvements for rabies diagnosis and surveillance. The advent of molecular biology and new technological initiatives that combine advances in biology with other disciplines will support the development of techniques capable of high throughput testing with a low turnaround time for rabies diagnosis.",2009-09-29,"Fooks, Anthony R.; Johnson, Nicholas; Freuling, Conrad M.; Wakeley, Philip R.; Banyard, Ashley C.; McElhinney, Lorraine M.; Marston, Denise A.; Dastjerdi, Akbar; Wright, Edward; Weiss, Robin A.; Müller, Thomas",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c6fde7aab8fedbe212cac83d89064d4fb74089b9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2745658.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2745658/,

We first performed a spatial analysis of the relative risk of HPAI H5N1 at the subdistrict level based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk. We then tested a set of potential risk factors in a multivariable linear model. The results confirmed the role of free-grazing ducks and rice-cropping intensity but showed a weak association with fighting cock density. The results also revealed a set of anthropogenic factors significantly linked with the risk of HPAI. High risk was associated strongly with densely populated areas, short distances to a highway junction, and short distances to large cities. These findings highlight a new explanatory pattern for the risk of HPAI and indicate that, in addition to agro-environmental factors, anthropogenic factors play an important role in the spread of H5N1.

By performing two cross-sectional questionnaire surveys during winter 2009 and winter 2010 among European travellers to resource-limited destinations, we aimed to investigate knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding seasonal influenza vaccination. METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed in the waiting room to the visitors of the University of Zurich Centre for Travel' Health (CTH) in January and February 2009 and January 2010 prior to travel health counselling (CTH09 and CTH10). Questions included demographic data, travel-related characteristics and KAP regarding influenza vaccination. Data were analysed by using SPSS(® )version 14.0 for Windows. Differences in proportions were compared using the Chi-square test and the significance level was set at p ≤ 0.05. Predictors for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination were determined by multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: With a response rate of 96.6%, 906 individuals were enrolled and 868 (92.5%) provided complete data. Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage was 13.7% (n = 119). Only 43 (14.2%) participants were vaccinated against pandemic influenza A/H1N1, mostly having received both vaccines simultaneously, the seasonal and pandemic one. Job-related purposes (44, 37%), age > 64 yrs (25, 21%) and recommendations of the family physician (27, 22.7%) were the most often reported reasons for being vaccinated. In the multiple logistic regression analyses of the pooled data increasing age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.04), a business trip (OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 - 0.92) and seasonal influenza vaccination in the previous winter seasons (OR = 12.91, 95% CI 8.09 - 20.58) were independent predictors for seasonal influenza vaccination in 2009 or 2010. Influenza vaccination recommended by the family doctor (327, 37.7%), travel to regions with known high risk of influenza (305, 35.1%), and influenza vaccination required for job purposes (233, 26.8%) were most frequently mentioned to consider influenza vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Risk perception and vaccination coverage concerning seasonal and pandemic influenza was very poor among travellers to resource-limited destinations when compared to traditional at-risk groups.

We previously reported that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) was involved in PRRSV-induced immunosuppression during an early phase of infection. However, the exact mechanism associated with PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra immunomodulation remains unknown. To explore the immunomodulatory properties of PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra on porcine immune functions, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) and leukocytes were cultured with type 2 PRRSV, and the immunological role of IL-1Ra was assessed by addition of anti-porcine IL-1Ra Ab. The results demonstrated that PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra reduced phagocytosis, surface expression of MHC II (SLA-DR) and CD86, as well as downregulation of IFNA and IL1 gene expression in the MoDC culture system. Interestingly, IL-1Ra secreted by the PRRSV-infected MoDC also inhibited T lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation, but not IFN-γ production. Although PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra was not directly linked to IL-10 production, it contributed to the differentiation of regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) within the culture system. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra downregulates innate immune functions, T lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation, and influences collectively with IL-10 in the Treg induction.

The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK(Ca)) and voltage-gated sodium channels were expressed in cortical neurons and play important roles in regulation of neuronal excitability. The present study aimed to determine the effects of resveratrol on BK(Ca) currents and voltage-gated sodium currents in cortical neurons. RESULTS: Resveratrol concentration-dependently increased the current amplitude and the opening activity of BK(Ca) channels, but suppressed the amplitude of voltage-gated sodium currents. Similar to the BK(Ca) channel opener NS1619, resveratrol decreased the firing rate of action potentials. In addition, the enhancing effects of BK(Ca) channel blockers tetraethylammonium (TEA) and paxilline on action potential firing were sensitive to resveratrol. Our results indicated that the attenuation of action potential firing rate by resveratrol might be mediated through opening the BK(Ca) channels and closing the voltage-gated sodium channels.

The degree of RSV replication was significantly reduced when X-31ca was administered before RSV infection without any RSV-specific antibody responses. The vaccination induced an immediate release of cytokines and infiltration of leukocytes into the respiratory tract, moderating the immune perturbation caused by RSV infection. The potency of protection against RSV challenge was significantly reduced in TLR3(-/-) TLR7(-/-) mice, confirming that the TLR3/7 signaling pathways are necessary for the observed immediate and short-term protection.

In viruses, the recombination rate depends on the frequency of genetic exchange between different viral genomes within an infected host cell and on the frequency at which such co-infections occur.

This study fills this gap using the cauliflower mosaic virus as a model. We distributed four neutral markers along the viral genome, and co-inoculated host plants with marker-containing and wild-type viruses. The frequency of recombinant genomes was evaluated 21 d post-inoculation. On average, over 50% of viral genomes recovered after a single host infection were recombinants, clearly indicating that recombination is very frequent in this virus. Estimates of the recombination rate show that all regions of the genome are equally affected by this process. Assuming that ten viral replication cycles occurred during our experiment—based on data on the timing of coat protein detection—the per base and replication cycle recombination rate was on the order of 2 × 10(−5) to 4 × 10(−5).

The present review focused on the effectiveness of NPPV in children > 1 month of age with acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to different conditions. ARF is the most common cause of cardiac arrest in children. Therefore, prompt recognition and treatment of pediatric patients with pending respiratory failure can be lifesaving. Mechanical respiratory support is a critical intervention in many cases of ARF. In recent years, NPPV has been proposed as a valuable alternative to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in this acute setting. Recent physiological studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of NPPV in children with ARF. Several pediatric clinical studies, the majority of which were noncontrolled or case series and of small size, have suggested the effectiveness of NPPV in the treatment of ARF due to acute airway (upper or lower) obstruction or certain primary parenchymal lung disease, and in specific circumstances, such as postoperative or postextubation ARF, immunocompromised patients with ARF, or as a means to facilitate extubation. NPPV was well tolerated with rare major complications and was associated with improved gas exchange, decreased work of breathing, and ETI avoidance in 22-100% of patients. High FiO(2 )needs or high PaCO(2 )level on admission or within the first hours after starting NPPV appeared to be the best independent predictive factors for the NPPV failure in children with ARF.

Ebola GP2 plays a critical role in virus entry and has similarities in mechanism and structure to the HIV gp41 protein for which inhibitors have been successfully developed. In this work, a putative binding pocket for the C-terminal heptad repeat in the N-terminal heptad repeat trimer was targeted for identification of small molecules that arrest EBOV-host membrane fusion. Two computational structure-based virtual screens of ∼1.7 M compounds were performed (DOCK program) against a GP2 five-helix bundle, resulting in 165 commercially available compounds purchased for experimental testing. Based on assessment of inhibitory activity, cytotoxicity, and target specificity, four promising candidates emerged with 50% inhibitory concentration values in the 3 to 26 μM range. Molecular dynamics simulations of the two most potent candidates in their DOCK-predicted binding poses indicate that the majority of favorable interactions involve seven highly conserved residues that can be used to guide further inhibitor development and refinement targeting EBOV. IMPORTANCE The most recent Ebola virus disease outbreak, from 2014 to 2016, resulted in approximately 28,000 individuals becoming infected, which led to over 12,000 causalities worldwide. The particularly high pathogenicity of the virus makes paramount the identification and development of promising lead compounds to serve as inhibitors of Ebola infection. To limit viral load, the virus-host membrane fusion event can be targeted through the inhibition of the class I fusion glycoprotein of Ebolavirus.

To maximize coding potential, RNA viruses often contain internally located stop codons that should also be prime targets for NMD. Using an agroinfiltration-based NMD assay in Nicotiana benthamiana, we identified two segments conferring NMD-resistance in the carmovirus Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) genome. The ribosome readthrough structure just downstream of the TCV p28 termination codon stabilized an NMD-sensitive reporter as did a frameshifting element from umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus. In addition, a 51-nt unstructured region (USR) at the beginning of the TCV 3’ UTR increased NMD-resistance 3-fold when inserted into an unrelated NMD-sensitive 3’ UTR. Several additional carmovirus 3’ UTRs also conferred varying levels of NMD resistance depending on the construct despite no sequence similarity in the analogous region. Instead, these regions displayed a marked lack of RNA structure immediately following the NMD-targeted stop codon. NMD-resistance was only slightly reduced by conversion of 19 pyrimidines in the USR to purines, but resistance was abolished when a 2-nt mutation was introduced downstream of the USR that substantially increased the secondary structure in the USR through formation of a stable hairpin. The same 2-nt mutation also enhanced the NMD susceptibility of a subgenomic RNA expressed independently of the genomic RNA. The conserved lack of RNA structure among most carmoviruses at the 5’ end of their 3’ UTR could serve to enhance subgenomic RNA stability, which would increase expression of the encoded capsid protein that also functions as the RNA silencing suppressor. These results demonstrate that the TCV genome has features that are inherently NMD-resistant and these strategies could be widespread among RNA viruses and NMD-resistant host mRNAs with long 3’ UTRs.",2018-11-19,"May, Jared P.; Yuan, Xuefeng; Sawicki, Erika; Simon, Anne E.",PLoS Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3aff001f58d03faf2bea881dfd5a0ea5706695ef.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6277124.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6277124/,

ProteinChip Biomarker System was used to evaluate 82 maternal serum samples, 78 urine samples and 76 amniotic fluid samples. The validity of classification tree was then challenged with a blind test set including another 20 NTD-mothers and 18 controls in serum samples, and another 19 NTD-mothers and 17 controls in urine samples, and another 20 NTD-mothers and 17 controls in amniotic fluid samples. Eight proteins detected in serum samples were up-regulated and four proteins were down-regulated in the NTD group. Four proteins detected in urine samples were up-regulated and one protein was down-regulated in the NTD group. Six proteins detected in amniotic fluid samples were up-regulated and one protein was down-regulated in the NTD group. The classification tree for serum samples separated NTDs from healthy individuals, achieving a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 97% in the training set, and achieving a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 97% and a positive predictive value of 95% in the test set. The classification tree for urine samples separated NTDs from controls, achieving a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 94% in the training set, and achieving a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 82% and a positive predictive value of 85% in the test set.

Correct handwashing can prevent 50 to 70% of water-infections and foodborne-infections. We report the results of a fact-finding study on general handwashing attitude and practice in the Republic of Korea by analyzing habits and awareness among adults and students (grades 4 to 12) based on the 2006 to 2014 National Handwashing Surveys and observational surveys. METHODS: The awareness survey was performed by telephone interviews with adults and students in 16 municipalities and provinces sampled by quota for region, sex and age. The observational survey was performed in subway, railway, and other public restrooms in seven municipalities selected through systematic sampling. RESULTS: Adults and students washed their hands with soap/sanitizer an average of 6.6 and 5.2 times daily, respectively, in 2014, an increase and decrease compared to 2006 (4.8) and 2013 (6.8). Their average daily handwashing frequency in 2014, 9.8 and 8.3, was higher than in 2006 (7.6), but lower than in 2013 (10.3).The percentage of participants handwashing with soap after using the restroom (29.5%) has been increasing since 2009, but remain slower than in other countries (42% to 49%). The percentages of participants handwashing with water in 2014, 2013, and 2011 were 57.5%, 72.6%, and 71.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Handwashing with soap is an important national public health issue, and national projects promoting it should be given high priority.

DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin, and interactions with mycobacterial cells are believed to occur via mannosylated structures on the mycobacterial surface. Recent studies suggest more varied modes of binding to multiple mycobacterial ligands. Here we identify, by affinity chromatography and mass-spectrometry, four novel ligands of M. bovis BCG that bind to DC-SIGN. The novel ligands are chaperone protein DnaK, 60 kDa chaperonin-1 (Cpn60.1), glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and lipoprotein lprG. Other published work strongly suggests that these are on the cell surface. Of these ligands, lprG appears to bind DC-SIGN via typical proteinglycan interactions, but DnaK and Cpn60.1 binding do not show evidence of carbohydrate-dependent interactions. LprG was also identified as a ligand for DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN; CD299) and the M. tuberculosis orthologue of lprG has been found previously to interact with human toll-like receptor 2.

We describe the functional significance of the PGRS domain of Rv0297, a member of this family. In silico analyses revealed the presence of intrinsically disordered stretches and putative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization signals in the PGRS domain of Rv0297 (Rv0297PGRS). The PGRS domain aids in ER localization, which was shown by infecting macrophage cells with M. tuberculosis and by overexpressing the protein by transfection in macrophage cells followed by activation of the unfolded protein response, as evident from increased expression of GRP78/GRP94 and CHOP/ATF4, leading to disruption of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and increased nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The consequent activation of the effector caspase-8 resulted in apoptosis of macrophages, which was Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent. Administration of recombinant Rv0297PGRS (rRv0297PGRS) also exhibited similar effects. These results implicate a hitherto-unknown role of the PGRS domain of the PE_PGRS protein family in ER stress-mediated cell death through TLR4.

Our previous study showed that two mutations (Y271A and I274A) in the turn RT (Gln(269)-Arg(277)) abrogated viral replication, but the replication capacity and RT activity was discordant. In this study, we further investigated why alanine substitutions at these two sites would affect viral replication. We found that both RT activity and RT protein were almost undetectable in viral particles of these two mutants, although the Pr160(gag-pol) mutants were properly expressed, transported and incorporated. Using protease inhibition assay, we demonstrated a correlation between the degradation of the RT mutants and the activity of viral protease. Our native gel analysis indicated that the mutations at 271 and 274 amino acids might cause conformational changes, leading to the formation of higher order oligomers instead of dimers, resulting in increased protein instability and susceptibility to viral protease. Thus, residues 271 and 274 are critical to RT stability and resistance to viral protease.

Probiotic microorganisms and other health improving food supplements have been given increasing attention in recent years, but, no information on the effects of probiotics on swine influenza virus is available. Here we address this question by assessing the inhibitory potential of the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 (E. faecium) on the replication of two porcine strains of influenza virus (H1N1 and H3N2 strain) in a continuous porcine macrophage cell line (3D4/21) and in MDBK cells. Cell cultures were treated with E. faecium at the non-toxic concentration of 1×10(6) CFU/ml in growth medium for 60 to 90 min before, during and after SwIV infection. After further incubation of cultures in probiotic-free growth medium, cell viability and virus propagation were determined at 48 h or 96 h post infection. The results obtained reveal an almost complete recovery of viability of SwIV infected cells and an inhibition of virus multiplication by up to four log units in the E. faecium treated cells. In both 3D4/21- and MDBK-cells a 60 min treatment with E. faecium stimulated nitric oxide (NO) release which is in line with published evidence for an antiviral function of NO. Furthermore, E. faecium caused a modified cellular expression of selected mediators of defence in 3D4-cells: while the expression of TNF-α, TLR-3 and IL-6 were decreased in the SwIV-infected and probiotic treated cells, IL-10 was found to be increased. Since we obtained experimental evidence for the direct adsorptive trapping of SwIV through E. faecium, this probiotic microorganism inhibits influenza viruses by at least two mechanisms, direct physical interaction and strengthening of innate defence at the cellular level.",2013-01-07,"Wang, Zhenya; Chai, Weidong; Burwinkel, Michael; Twardziok, Sven; Wrede, Paul; Palissa, Christiane; Esch, Bettina; Schmidt, Michael F.

However, the mechanisms involved in neutrophil transmigration, location and accumulation in the ischemic brain are not fully elucidated. Neutrophils can reach the perivascular spaces of brain vessels after crossing the endothelial cell layer and endothelial basal lamina of post-capillary venules, or migrating from the leptomeninges following pial vessel extravasation and/or a suggested translocation from the skull bone marrow. Based on previous observations of microglia phagocytosing neutrophils recruited to the ischemic brain lesion, we hypothesized that microglial cells might control neutrophil accumulation in the injured brain. We studied a model of permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice, including microglia- and neutrophil-reporter mice. Using various in vitro and in vivo strategies to impair microglial function or to eliminate microglia by targeting colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), this study demonstrates that microglial phagocytosis of neutrophils has fundamental consequences for the ischemic tissue. We found that reactive microglia engulf neutrophils at the periphery of the ischemic lesion, whereas local microglial cell loss and dystrophy occurring in the ischemic core are associated with the accumulation of neutrophils first in perivascular spaces and later in the parenchyma. Accordingly, microglia depletion by long-term treatment with a CSF1R inhibitor increased the numbers of neutrophils and enlarged the ischemic lesion. Hence, microglial phagocytic function sets a critical line of defense against the vascular and tissue damaging capacity of neutrophils in brain ischemia.

Evidence evaluating the association between NOAF and patient-important outcomes in this population is conflicting. Furthermore, little is known regarding the association between NOAF and resource use or hospital costs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis (2011–2016) of a prospectively collected registry from two Canadian hospitals of consecutive ICU patients aged ≥ 18 years. We excluded patients with a known history of AF prior to hospital admission. Any occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) was prospectively recorded by bedside nurses. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and we used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for confounders. We used a generalized linear model to evaluate contributors to total cost. RESULTS: We included 15,014 patients, and 1541 (10.3%) had NOAF during their ICU admission. While NOAF was not associated with increased odds of hospital death among the entire cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.02 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97–1.08]), an interaction was noted between NOAF and sepsis, and the presence of both was associated with higher odds of hospital mortality (aOR 1.28 [95% CI 1.09–1.36]) than either alone. Patients with NOAF had higher total costs (cost ratio [CR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.02–1.20]). Among patients with NOAF, treatment with a rhythm-control strategy was associated with higher costs (CR 1.24 [95% CI 1.07–1.40]).

To date, no pandemic emergence of a new influenza strain has been preceded by detection of a closely related precursor in an animal or human. Nonetheless, influenza surveillance efforts are expanding, prompting a need for tools to assess the pandemic risk posed by a detected virus. The goal would be to use genetic sequence and/or biological assays of viral traits to identify those non-human influenza viruses with the greatest risk of evolving into pandemic threats, and/or to understand drivers of such evolution, to prioritize pandemic prevention or response measures. We describe such efforts, identify progress and ongoing challenges, and discuss three specific traits of influenza viruses (hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity, hemagglutinin pH of activation, and polymerase complex efficiency) that contribute to pandemic risk.

Suitable tools for live-cell imaging of enterovirus ROs are currently unavailable, as recombinant enteroviruses that carry genes that encode RO-anchored viral proteins tagged with fluorescent reporters have not been reported thus far. To overcome this limitation, we used a split green fluorescent protein (split-GFP) system, comprising a large fragment [strands 1 to 10; GFP(S1-10)] and a small fragment [strand 11; GFP(S11)] of only 16 residues. The GFP(S11) (GFP with S11 fragment) fragment was inserted into the 3A protein of the enterovirus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), while the large fragment was supplied by transient or stable expression in cells. The introduction of GFP(S11) did not affect the known functions of 3A when expressed in isolation. Using correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM), we showed that GFP fluorescence was detected at ROs, whose morphologies are essentially identical to those previously observed for wild-type CVB3, indicating that GFP(S11)-tagged 3A proteins assemble with GFP(S1-10) to form GFP for illumination of bona fide ROs. It is well established that enterovirus infection leads to Golgi disintegration. Through live-cell imaging of infected cells expressing an mCherry-tagged Golgi marker, we monitored RO development and revealed the dynamics of Golgi disassembly in real time. Having demonstrated the suitability of this virus for imaging ROs, we constructed a CVB3 encoding GFP(S1-10) and GFP(S11)-tagged 3A to bypass the need to express GFP(S1-10) prior to infection. These tools will have multiple applications in future studies on the origin, location, and function of enterovirus ROs. IMPORTANCE Enteroviruses induce the formation of membranous structures (replication organelles [ROs]) with a unique protein and lipid composition specialized for genome replication. Electron microscopy has revealed the morphology of enterovirus ROs, and immunofluorescence studies have been conducted to investigate their origin and formation. Yet, immunofluorescence analysis of fixed cells results in a rather static view of RO formation, and the results may be compromised by immunolabeling artifacts. While live-cell imaging of ROs would be preferred, enteroviruses encoding a membrane-anchored viral protein fused to a large fluorescent reporter have thus far not been described. Here, we tackled this constraint by introducing a small tag from a split-GFP system into an RO-resident enterovirus protein. This new tool bridges a methodological gap by circumventing the need for immunolabeling fixed cells and allows the study of the dynamics and formation of enterovirus ROs in living cells.",2016-07-06,"van der Schaar, H.

This is the first description of cellular miRNAs modulating MEV infection in F81 cells, providing further insight into the mechanisms of viral infection, and may be useful in development of naturally-occurring miRNAs antiviral strategies.",2013-12-11,"Sun, Jia-zeng; Wang, Jigui; Yuan, Daoli; Wang, Shuang; Li, Zhili; Yi, Bao; Mao, Yaping; Hou, Qiang; Liu, Weiquan",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/cf7837069ab6a12d5663c6f3c715b73fe53493a1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3859502.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3859502/,

In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of GA against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced damage to differentiated PC12 (DPC12) cells. Compared with the MPP(+)-treated cells, GA markedly improved cell viability, restored mitochondrial dysfunction, suppressed the overexpression of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and suppressed the overproduction of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and intracellular Ca(2+) overload. The protective effects of GA on cell survival were further confirmed in primary cortical neurons. GA markedly increased the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), as well as its migration from the cytoplasm to nucleus. PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK, blocked GA-enhanced ERK activation and reduced cell viability. However, pre-treatment with GA had no effects on the expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and total AKT (t-AKT). These results indicate that the GA-mediated neuroprotective effects are associated with its modulation of multiple anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors, particularly the ERK signaling pathway.

Aluminum hydroxide (alum) is the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant, yet its adjuvanticity is often weak and mechanisms of triggering antibody responses remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that site-specific modification of immunogens with short peptides composed of repeating phosphoserine (pSer) residues enhances binding to alum and prolongs immunogen bioavailability. The pSer-modified immunogens formulated in alum elicited greatly increased germinal center, antibody, neutralizing antibody, memory and long-lived plasma cell responses compared to conventional alum-adsorbed immunogens. Mechanistically, pSer-immunogen:alum complexes form nanoparticles that traffic to lymph nodes and trigger B cell activation through multivalent and oriented antigen display. Direct uptake of antigen-decorated alum particles by B cells upregulated antigen processing and presentation pathways, further enhancing B cell activation.

Innate immunity activation plays a central role in the development of ALI. Innate immunity is activated through families of related pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize conserved microbial motifs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Toll-like receptors were the first major family of PRRs discovered in mammals. Recently, NACHT–leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors and retinoic acid–inducible gene–like receptors have been added to the list. It is now understood that in addition to recognizing infectious stimuli, both Toll-like receptors and NACHT-LRR receptors can also respond to endogenous molecules released in response to stress, trauma and cell damage. These molecules have been termed damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). It has been clinically observed for a long time that infectious and noninfectious insults initiate inflammation, so confirmation of overlapping receptor-signal pathways of activation between PAMPs and DAMPs is no surprise.

Chronic intermittent hypoxia is used to model the arterial hypoxemia seen in SA, and through this paradigm, the mechanisms that underlie SA-induced hypertension are becoming clear. Cyclic hypoxic exposure during sleep chronically stimulates the carotid chemoreflexes, inducing sensory long-term facilitation, and drives sympathetic outflow from the hindbrain. The elevated sympathetic tone drives hypertension and renal sympathetic activity to the kidneys resulting in increased plasma renin activity and eventually angiotensin II (Ang II) peripherally. Upon waking, when respiration is normalized, the sympathetic activity does not diminish. This is partially because of adaptations leading to overactivation of the hindbrain regions controlling sympathetic outflow such as the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), and rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The sustained sympathetic activity is also due to enhanced synaptic signaling from the forebrain through the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). During the waking hours, when the chemoreceptors are not exposed to hypoxia, the forebrain circumventricular organs (CVOs) are stimulated by peripherally circulating Ang II from the elevated plasma renin activity. The CVOs and median preoptic nucleus chronically activate the PVN due to the Ang II signaling.

Climate and weather factors are known to affect the transmission and distribution of infectious diseases and statistical and mathematical modelling are continuously developing to investigate the impact of weather and climate on water-associated diseases. There have been little critical analyses of the methodological approaches. Our objective is to review and summarize statistical and modelling methods used to investigate the effects of weather and climate on infectious diseases associated with water, in order to identify limitations and knowledge gaps in developing of new methods.

The most commonly used methods were grouped in two clusters: process-based models (PBM) and time series and spatial epidemiology (TS-SE). In general, PBM methods were employed when the bio-physical mechanism of the pathogen under study was relatively well known (e.g. Vibrio cholerae); TS-SE tended to be used when the specific environmental mechanisms were unclear (e.g. Campylobacter). Important data and methodological challenges emerged, with implications for surveillance and control of water-associated infections. The most common limitations comprised: non-inclusion of key factors (e.g. biological mechanism, demographic heterogeneity, human behavior), reporting bias, poor data quality, and collinearity in exposures. Furthermore, the methods often did not distinguish among the multiple sources of time-lags (e.g. patient physiology, reporting bias, healthcare access) between environmental drivers/exposures and disease detection.

Hepcidin is a β-defensin-like antimicrobial peptide and acts as a principal iron regulatory hormone. Hepcidin is mostly produced by hepatocytes, but is also expressed by other cells, such as airway epithelial cells. However, nothing is known about its function in lung infections and inflammatory diseases. We therefore sought to investigate the role of airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin in sepsis-induced acute lung injury. METHODS: Acute lung injury was induced by polymicrobial sepsis via cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery. Adenovirus-mediated short hairpin RNA specific for the mouse hepcidin gene hepc1 and control adenovirus were intratracheally injected into mice. The adenovirus-mediated knockdown of hepcidin in airway epithelial cells was evaluated in vivo. Lung injury and the seven-day survival rate were assessed. The levels of hepcidin-related iron export protein ferroportin were measured, and the iron content and function of alveolar macrophages were evaluated. RESULTS: The hepcidin level in airway epithelial cells was upregulated during polymicrobial sepsis. The knockdown of airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin aggravated the polymicrobial sepsis-induced lung injury and pulmonary bacterial infection and increased mortality (53.33% in Ad-shHepc1-treated mice versus 12.5% in Ad-shNeg-treated mice, P <0.05). The knockdown of hepcidin in airway epithelial cells also led to reduced ferroportin degradation and a low intracellular iron content in alveolar macrophages. Moreover, alveolar macrophages form the airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin knockdown mice showed impaired phagocytic ability than those from the control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin plays an important role in CLP-induced acute lung injury. The severe lung injury in the airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin knockdown mice is at least partially related to the altered intracellular iron level and function of alveolar macrophages.",2014-08-06,"Chen, Qi Xing; Song, Sheng Wen; Chen, Qing Hua; Zeng, Cong Li; Zheng, Xia; Wang, Jun Lu; Fang, Xiang Ming",Crit Care,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d725cbad904550149fb46b71ec99629edbed74ab.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4243715.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4243715/,

The molecular basis of the CesT/CsrA binding, however, remains elusive. Here, we show that CesT and CsrA both created two ligand binding sites in their homodimers, forming irregular multimeric complexes in solution. Through construction of a recombinant CsrA-dimer (Re-CsrA) that contains a single CesT binding site, the atomic binding features between CesT and CsrA are delineated via the structure of the CesT/Re-CsrA complex. In contrast to a previously reported N-terminally swapped dimer-form, CesT adopts a dimeric architecture with a swapped C-terminal helix for CsrA engagement. In CsrA, CesT binds to a surface patch that extensively overlaps with its mRNA binding site. The binding mode therefore justifies a mechanism of CsrA-modulation by CesT via competitive inhibition of the CsrA/mRNA interactions.",2018-03-22,"Ye, Fei; Yang, Fanli; Yu, Ruijie; Lin, Xi; Qi, Jianxun; Chen, Zhujun; Cao, Yu; Wei, Yuquan; Gao, George F.; Lu, Guangwen",Nat Commun,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7f011d5856d476496de3e715d8f77908f2610e30.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5864733.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5864733/,

METHODS: In this post hoc analysis we compared the mortality rates of 135 consecutive liver transplant recipients over 6 years in our center subject to their renal baseline conditions and postoperative RRT. We classified the patients into 4 groups, according to their preoperative calculated Cockcroft formula and the incidence of postoperative renal replacement therapy. Data then were analyzed in regard to mortality rates and in addition to pre- and peritransplant risk factors. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in ICU mortality (p=.008), hospital mortality (p=.002) and cumulative survival (p<.0001) between the groups. The highest mortality rate occurred in the group with RRT and normal baseline kidney function (20% ICU mortality, 26.6% hospital mortality and 50% cumulative 1-year mortality, respectively).

Molecular understanding of the underlying mechanisms is not complete. Airway epithelial ion transport regulates the homeostasis of airway surface liquid, essential for airway mucosal immunity and lung host defense. Here, air-liquid interface cultures of Calu-3 epithelial cells were basolaterally exposed to physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol (0, 25, 50 and 100 mM) for 24 hours and adenosine-stimulated ion transport was measured by Ussing chamber. The ethanol exposure reduced the epithelial short-circuit currents (I(SC)) in a dose-dependent manner. The ion currents activated by adenosine were chloride conductance mediated by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated chloride channel. Alloxazine, a specific inhibitor for A(2B) adenosine receptor (A(2B)AR), largely abolished the adenosine-stimulated chloride transport, suggesting that A(2B)AR is a major receptor responsible for regulating the chloride transport of the cells. Ethanol significantly reduced intracellular cAMP production upon adenosine stimulation. Moreover, ethanol-suppression of the chloride secretion was able to be restored by cAMP analogs or by inhibitors to block cAMP degradation. These results imply that ethanol exposure dysregulates CFTR-mediated chloride transport in airways by suppression of adenosine-A(2B)AR-cAMP signaling pathway, which might contribute to alcohol-associated lung infections.",2012-03-19,"Raju, Sammeta V.; Wang, Guoshun",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b85671451a6132068f92e5da9590cbc9ee5867d5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3307712.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3307712/,

Pneumocystis was diagnosed by microscopy using Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain in 12 cases and by nested PCR using mtLSUrRNA in 25 cases. Genotyping was performed using three different genes, mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mtLSUrRNA), dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). mtLSUrRNA genotype 3 and novel mutations at the gene target DHFR (401 T > C) and DHPS 96/98 were frequently observed and clinically associated with severe PCP and treatment failure.

METHODS: A prospective multicenter study (GENDRES-network) was conducted between 2011–2013 in children under the age of two admitted to hospital because of an ARI. Among those RSV-positive, bacterial presence in blood was assessed using PCR for Meningococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, in addition to conventional cultures. RESULTS: 66 children with positive RSV respiratory illness were included. In 10.6% patients, bacterial presence was detected: H. influenzae (n = 4) and S. pneumoniae (n = 2).

We report here the role of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), a constitutively expressed secretory enzyme of H. pylori, in potentiating VacA-dependent vacuolation formation in H. pylori-infected AGS and primary gastric cells. The enhancement is brought about by GGT hydrolysing glutamine present in the extracellular medium, thereby releasing ammonia which accentuates the VacA-induced vacuolation. The events of vacuolation in H. pylori wild type (WT)- and Δggt-infected AGS cells were first captured and visualized by real-time phase-contrast microscopy where WT was observed to induce more vacuoles than Δggt. By using semi-quantitative neutral red uptake assay, we next showed that Δggt induced significantly less vacuolation in AGS and primary gastric epithelial cells as compared to the parental strain (P<0.05) indicating that GGT potentiates the vacuolating effect of VacA. Notably, vacuolation induced by WT was significantly reduced in the absence of GGT substrate, glutamine (P<0.05) or in the presence of a competitive GGT inhibitor, serine-borate complex. Furthermore, the vacuolating ability of Δggt was markedly restored when co-incubated with purified recombinant GGT (rGGT), although rGGT itself did not induce vacuolation independently. Similarly, the addition of exogenous ammonium chloride as a source of ammonia also rescued the ability of Δggt to induce vacuolation. Additionally, we also show that monoclonal antibodies against GGT effectively inhibited GGT activity and successfully suppressed H. pylori-induced vacuolation. Collectively, our results clearly demonstrate that generation of ammonia by GGT through glutamine hydrolysis is responsible for enhancing VacA-dependent vacuolation.

To help clinicians triage adults with acute respiratory illness, a scoring system for influenza-like illness (ILI) was implemented at Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Mexico. METHODS: A medical history, laboratory and radiology results were collected on emergency room (ER) patients with acute respiratory illness to calculate an ILI-score. Patients were evaluated for admission by their ILI-score and clinicians' assessment of risk for developing complications. Nasal and throat swabs were collected from intermediate and high-risk patients for influenza testing by RT-PCR. The disposition and ILI-score of those oseltamivir-treated versus untreated, clinical characteristics of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) patients versus test-negative patients were compared by Pearson's Χ(2), Fisher's Exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

Pathogen survival and mucus viscosity were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient >0.7, P < 0.001). Additionally, the ethanol diffusion rate decreased with increasing mucus viscosity, which contributed to ethanol resistance. Pronase treatment of sputum samples significantly decreased sputum viscosity and increased the disinfectant effect (P < 0.001 for all).

In our recent study, we have taken advantage of viruses as a screening tool to determine the extent of the unconventional functions of the ATG proteome and characterize one of them.",2016-12-30,"Mauthe, Mario; Reggiori, Fulvio",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e26474402fd9115dc8eb973eaea16e34a4bc9d1d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5354549.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5354549/,

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce fibroblast proliferation and differentiation through activation of phosphoinositide3-Kinase (PI3-K) pathway. However, the detail mechanism by which LPS contributes to the development of lung fibrosis is not clearly understood. To investigate the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a PI3-K pathway suppressor, on LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation, collagen secretion and activation of PI3-K, we transfected PTEN overexpression lentivirus into cultured mouse lung fibroblasts with or without LPS treatment to evaluate proliferation by MTT and Flow cytometry assays. Expression of PTEN, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) and phosphorylation of Akt were determined by Western-blot or real-time RT-PCR assays. The PTEN phosphorylation activity was measured by a malachite green-based assay. The content of C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) in cell culture supernatants was examined by ELISA. RESULTS: We found that overexpression of PTEN effectively increased expression and phosphatase activity of PTEN, and concomitantly inhibited LPS-induced fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion. Phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3beta protein expression levels in the LPS-induced PTEN overexpression transfected cells were significantly lower than those in the LPS-induced non-transfected cells, which can be reversed by the PTEN inhibitor, bpV(phen). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results show that overexpression and induced phosphatase activity of PTEN inhibits LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion through inactivation of PI3-K-Akt-GSK3beta signaling pathways, which can be abrogated by a selective PTEN inhibitor. Thus, expression and phosphatase activity of PTEN could be a potential therapeutic target for LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Compared with PTEN expression level, phosphatase activity of PTEN is more crucial in affecting lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion.",2014-01-06,"He, Zhengyu; Deng, Yuxiao; Li, Wen; Chen, Yongming; Xing, Shunpeng; Zhao, Xianyuan; Ding, Jia; Gao, Yuan; Wang, Xiangrui",Cell Biosci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/62f5dc6a3bf7eaffcf4a955b6358e27dd13d0fa5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3892003.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892003/,

NF-κB-driven transcription of proapoptotic cellular genes is required for the effector phase of the apoptotic response. Although both extrinsic death-receptor signaling pathways and intrinsic pathways involving mitochondrial injury are implicated in reovirus-induced apoptosis, mechanisms by which either of these pathways are activated and their relationship to NF-κB signaling following reovirus infection are unknown. The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bid, is activated by proteolytic cleavage following reovirus infection. To understand how reovirus integrates host signaling circuits to induce apoptosis, we examined proapoptotic signaling following infection of Bid-deficient cells. Although reovirus growth was not affected by the absence of Bid, cells lacking Bid failed to undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that NF-κB activation is required for Bid cleavage and subsequent proapoptotic signaling. To examine the functional significance of Bid-dependent apoptosis in reovirus disease, we monitored fatal encephalitis caused by reovirus in the presence and absence of Bid. Survival of Bid-deficient mice was significantly enhanced in comparison to wild-type mice following either peroral or intracranial inoculation of reovirus. Decreased reovirus virulence in Bid-null mice was accompanied by a reduction in viral yield.

We have previously shown that antigen-specific, IL-17-producing CD4(+) T cells can provide capsular antibody-independent protection against nasal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae; but whether pneumococcus-responsive T(RM) are localized within the nasal mucosa and are sufficient for protection from carriage has not been determined. Here we show that intranasal administration of live or killed pneumococci to mice generates pneumococcus-responsive IL-17A-producing CD4(+) mucosal T(RM). Furthermore, we show that these cells are sufficient to mediate long-lived, neutrophil-dependent protection against subsequent pneumococcal nasal challenge. Unexpectedly, and in contrast with the prevailing paradigm, we found that parenteral administration of killed pneumococci also generates protective IL-17A(+)CD4(+) T(RM) in the nasal mucosa. These results demonstrate a critical and sufficient role of T(RM) in prevention of pneumococcal colonization, and further that these cells can be generated by parenteral immunization.

The critical role of public health in the context of disease surveillance was recognized with recommendations for electronic laboratory reporting (ELR). Many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts. OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to understand the process of data exchange and its impact on the quality of data being transmitted in the context of electronic laboratory reporting to public health. This was conducted in context of Minnesota Electronic Disease Surveillance System (MEDSS), the public health information system for supporting infectious disease surveillance in Minnesota. Data Quality (DQ) dimensions by Strong et al., was chosen as the guiding framework for evaluation. METHODS: The process of assessing data exchange for electronic lab reporting and its impact was a mixed methods approach with qualitative data obtained through expert discussions and quantitative data obtained from queries of the MEDSS system. Interviews were conducted in an open-ended format from November 2017 through February 2018. Based on these discussions, two high level categories of data exchange process which could impact data quality were identified: onboarding for electronic lab reporting and internal data exchange routing. This in turn comprised of ten critical steps and its impact on quality of data was identified through expert input. This was followed by analysis of data in MEDSS by various criteria identified by the informatics team. RESULTS: All DQ metrics (Intrinsic DQ, Contextual DQ, Representational DQ, and Accessibility DQ) were impacted in the data exchange process with varying influence on DQ dimensions. Some errors such as improper mapping in electronic health records (EHRs) and laboratory information systems had a cascading effect and can pass through technical filters and go undetected till use of data by epidemiologists. Some DQ dimensions such as accuracy, relevancy, value-added data and interpretability are more dependent on users at either end of the data exchange spectrum, the relevant clinical groups and the public health program professionals. The study revealed that data quality is dynamic and on-going oversight is a combined effort by MEDSS Informatics team and review by technical and public health program professionals. CONCLUSION: With increasing electronic reporting to public health, there is a need to understand the current processes for electronic exchange and their impact on quality of data. This study focused on electronic laboratory reporting to public health and analyzed both onboarding and internal data exchange processes. Insights gathered from this research can be applied to other public health reporting currently (e.g. immunizations) and will be valuable in planning for electronic case reporting in near future.",2018-09-21,"Rajamani, Sripriya; Kayser, Ann; Emerson, Emily; Solarz, Sarah",Online J Public Health Inform,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/23e73664ec4374d13d3a5243006bec6f30f5cda4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6194099.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6194099/,

Therefore it is possible that the immunopathology differs among the various presentations of DAD. The aim of this study is to compare lung immunopathology of viral (influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) to non-viral, extrapulmonary aetiologies in autopsy cases with DAD. METHODS: The lung tissue of 44 patients, was divided in the H1N1 group (n = 15) characterized by severe pulmonary injury due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection; the ARDS group (n = 13), characterized by patients with DAD due to non-pulmonary causes; and the Control group (n = 16), consisting of patients with non-pulmonary causes of death. Immunohistochemistry and image analysis were used to quantify, in the parenchyma and small airways, several immune cell markers. RESULTS: Both DAD groups had higher expression of neutrophils and macrophages in parenchyma and small airways. However, there was a higher expression of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD83+ dendritic cells, granzyme A+ and natural killer + cell density in the lung parenchyma of the H1N1 group (p < 0.05). In the small airways, there was a lower cell density of tryptase + mast cells and dendritic + cells and an increase of IL-17 in both DAD groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: DAD due to viral A(H1N1)pdm09 is associated with a cytotoxic inflammatory phenotype, with partially divergent responses in the parenchyma relative to the small airways. In non-viral DAD, main immune cell alterations were found at the small airway level, reinforcing the role of the small airways in the pathogenesis of the exudative phase of DAD.

However, it is unclear whether some virus families have a greater propensity to jump host species than others. If related viruses have an evolutionary history of co-divergence with their hosts there should be evidence of topological similarities between the virus and host phylogenetic trees, whereas host jumping generates incongruent tree topologies. By analyzing co-phylogenetic processes in 19 virus families and their eukaryotic hosts we provide a quantitative and comparative estimate of the relative frequency of virus-host co-divergence versus cross-species transmission among virus families. Notably, our analysis reveals that cross-species transmission is a near universal feature of the viruses analyzed here, with virus-host co-divergence occurring less frequently and always on a subset of viruses. Despite the overall high topological incongruence among virus and host phylogenies, the Hepadnaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae, Papillomaviridae and Adenoviridae, all of which possess double-stranded DNA genomes, exhibited more frequent co-divergence than the other virus families studied here. At the other extreme, the virus and host trees for all the RNA viruses studied here, particularly the Rhabdoviridae and the Picornaviridae, displayed high levels of topological incongruence, indicative of frequent host switching. Overall, we show that cross-species transmission plays a major role in virus evolution, with all the virus families studied here having the potential to jump host species, and that increased sampling will likely reveal more instances of host jumping.",2017-02-08,"Geoghegan, Jemma L.; Duchêne, Sebastián; Holmes, Edward C.",PLoS Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3ac512d142c583daae040f2dc71312ea804b4f0a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5319820.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5319820/,

This prospective observational pilot study was carried out during the bronchiolitis season 2011–2012 in a pediatric tertiary care academic center in Italy. Interruptions of HFNC therapy and possible side effects or escalation to other forms of respiratory support were recorded. Oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)), and respiratory rate (RR), measured for a baseline period of 1 h before and at specific time intervals in 48 h after the start of HFNC were recorded.

This host shutoff phenotype is orchestrated by the viral SOX protein, yet its functional significance to the viral lifecycle has not been elucidated, in part due to the multifunctional nature of SOX. Using an unbiased mutagenesis screen of the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) SOX homolog, we isolated a single amino acid point mutant that is selectively defective in host shutoff activity. Incorporation of this mutation into MHV68 yielded a virus with significantly reduced capacity for mRNA turnover. Unexpectedly, the MHV68 mutant showed little defect during the acute replication phase in the mouse lung. Instead, the virus exhibited attenuation at later stages of in vivo infections suggestive of defects in both trafficking and latency establishment. Specifically, mice intranasally infected with the host shutoff mutant accumulated to lower levels at 10 days post infection in the lymph nodes, failed to develop splenomegaly, and exhibited reduced viral DNA levels and a lower frequency of latently infected splenocytes. Decreased latency establishment was also observed upon infection via the intraperitoneal route. These results highlight for the first time the importance of global mRNA degradation during a gammaherpesvirus infection and link an exclusively lytic phenomenon with downstream latency establishment.",2011-07-21,"Richner, Justin M.; Clyde, Karen; Pezda, Andrea C.; Cheng, Benson Yee Hin; Wang, Tina; Kumar, G.

It is not structurally related to other major apolipoproteins and has been known as a small, soluble carrier protein of lipophilic molecules that is mostly expressed in neurons and glial cells within the central and peripheral nervous system. Recent data indicate that ApoD not only supplies cells with lipophilic molecules, but also controls the fate of these ligands by modulating their stability and oxidation status. Of particular interest is the binding of ApoD to arachidonic acid and its derivatives, which play a central role in healthy brain function. ApoD has been shown to act as a catalyst in the reduction of peroxidized eicosanoids and to attenuate lipid peroxidation in the brain. Manipulating its expression level in fruit flies and mice has demonstrated that ApoD has a favorable effect on both stress resistance and life span. The APOD gene is the gene that is upregulated the most in the aging human brain. Furthermore, ApoD levels in the nervous system are elevated in a large number of neurologic disorders including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and stroke. There is increasing evidence for a prominent neuroprotective role of ApoD because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. ApoD emerges as an evolutionarily conserved anti-stress protein that is induced by oxidative stress and inflammation and may prove to be an effective therapeutic agent against a variety of neuropathologies, and even against aging.",2014-07-03,"Dassati, Sarah; Waldner, Andreas; Schweigreiter, Rüdiger",Neurobiol Aging,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3988949.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988949/,

METHODS: Using hybridoma technology, we generated a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against recombinant human RANK receptor and characterized by SDS PAGE, ELISA, Western Blot and immunocytochemistry, then synthesized osteoclast-targeting bioconjugates of salmon calcitonin (sCT) using this antibody by generating thiol groups on mAb using 2-Iminothiolane and subsequently reacting them with sCT-PEG-MAL synthesised from sCT and NHS-PEG-MAL. To test the efficacy of the conjugate in vitro, osteoclasts were generated from precursor RAW 264.7 cells by dosing with the cytokines macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and RANK Ligand (RANKL) and TRAP activity assay, Resorption Pit Assay, TRAP staining were performed. Cytotoxicity of the mAb-sCT conjugate was also evaluated in RAW 264.7 cells; sCT bioactivity and CTR binding potential were evaluated by in vitro intracellular cAMP stimulation assay in human T47D breast cancer cells. RESULTS: Generation of antibody against human RANK receptor was confirmed by SDS PAGE, ELISA and Western Blot. Immunocytochemistry confirmed the osteoclast targeting potential of the antibody. Successful conjugation of the antibody with sCT was confirmed by SDS PAGE and ELISA.Multinucleated osteoclast formation was confirmed by staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Conjugate functionality was confirmed by TRAP activity and Resorption Pit assay, showing the inhibitory effect on osteoclast differentiation. cAMP assay confirmed the retention of calcitonin bioactivity after conjugation.

High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a DNA-binding nuclear protein that can act as an alarmin, a danger signal to alert the innate immune system for the initiation of host defense. It is the prototypic damage-associated molecular pattern molecule, and it can be secreted by innate cells, including DCs and natural killer (NK) cells. The fate of DCs is dependent on a cognate interaction with NK cells, which involves HMGB1 expressed at NK–DC synapse. HMGB1 is essential for DC maturation, migration to lymphoid tissues and functional type-1 polarization of naïve T cells.

Each population of RNA virus is composed of a collection of different, yet related genomes often referred to as mutant spectra or quasispecies. Virologists using deep sequencing technologies face major obstacles when studying virus population dynamics, both experimentally and in natural settings due to the relatively high error rates of these technologies and the lack of high performance pipelines. In order to overcome these hurdles we developed a computational pipeline, termed ViVan (Viral Variance Analysis). ViVan is a complete pipeline facilitating the identification, characterization and comparison of sequence variance in deep sequenced virus populations. Results: Applying ViVan on deep sequenced data obtained from samples that were previously characterized by more classical approaches, we uncovered novel and potentially crucial aspects of virus populations. With our experimental work, we illustrate how ViVan can be used for studies ranging from the more practical, detection of resistant mutations and effects of antiviral treatments, to the more theoretical temporal characterization of the population in evolutionary studies.

One approach to the development of a malaria vaccine is to target the asexual blood stage that results in clinical symptoms. Most attempts have failed. New antigens such as P27A and P27 have emerged as potential new vaccine candidates. Multiple studies have demonstrated that antigens are more immunogenic and are better correlated with protection when presented on particulate delivery systems. One such particulate delivery system is the self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN) that relies on coiled-coil domains of proteins to form stable nanoparticles. In the past we have used de novo designed amino acid domains to drive the formation of the coiled-coil scaffolds which present the antigenic epitopes on the particle surface. RESULTS: Here we use naturally occurring domains found in the tex1 protein to form the coiled-coil scaffolding of the nanoparticle. Thus, by engineering P27A and a new extended form of the coiled-coil domain P27 onto the N and C terminus of the SAPN protein monomer we have developed a particulate delivery system that effectively displays both antigens on a single particle that uses malaria tex1 sequences to form the nanoparticle scaffold. These particles are immunogenic in a murine model and induce immune responses similar to the ones observed in seropositive individuals in malaria endemic regions. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that our P27/P27A-SAPNs induce an immune response akin to the one in seropositive individuals in Burkina Faso. Since P27 is highly conserved among different Plasmodium species, these novel SAPNs may even provide cross-protection between Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax the two major human malaria pathogens. As the SAPNs are also easy to manufacture and store they can be delivered to the population in need without complication thus providing a low cost malaria vaccine.",2017-09-06,"Karch, Christopher P.; Doll, Tais A.

Guidelines recommend high-dose steroids treatment despite unproven benefit. We hypothesized that previous immunosuppression and the administration of high-dose steroids adversely affect IPF-AE outcome. METHODS: We studied all consecutive patients hospitalized in our department for IPF deterioration from 2007 to June 2013. Our protocol consisted of immediate cessation of immunosuppression (if any), best supportive care, broad-spectrum antimicrobials and thorough evaluation to detect reversible causes of deterioration. Patients were followed-up for survival; post-discharge none received immunosuppression. RESULTS: Twenty-four out of 85 admissions (28 %) fulfilled IPF-AE criteria. IPF-AE were analyzed both as unique events and as unique patients.

Soluble ACE2 fragments are shed from the proximal tubule, and appear at high levels in the urine with diabetes. High glucose-induced shedding of ACE2 from proximal tubular cells is mediated by the enzyme “a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17″ (ADAM17). Here, we investigated the mechanism for constitutive shedding of ACE2. Mouse proximal tubular cells were cultured and ACE2 shedding into the media was assessed by enzyme activity assay and immunoblot analysis. Cells were incubated with pharmacologic inhibitors, or transfected with silencing (si) RNA. Incubation of proximal tubular cells with increasing concentrations of D-glucose stimulated ACE2 shedding, which peaked at 16 mM, while L-glucose (osmotic control) had no effect on shedding. In cells maintained in 7.8 mM D-glucose, ACE2 shedding was significantly inhibited by the pan-protein kinase C (PKC) competitive inhibitor sotrastaurin, but not by an inhibitor of ADAM17. Incubation of cells with the PKC-α and -β1-specific inhibitor Go6976, the PKC β1 and β2-specific inhibitor ruboxistaurin, inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases-2,-8, and -9, or an inhibitor of ADAM10 (GI250423X) had no effect on basal ACE2 shedding. By contrast, the PKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin significantly inhibited both constitutive and high glucose-induced ACE2 shedding. Transfection of cells with siRNA directed against PKC-δ reduced ACE2 shedding by 20%, while knockdown of PKC-ε was without effect. These results indicate that constitutive shedding of ACE2 from proximal tubular cells is mediated by PKC-δ, which is also linked to high glucose-induced shedding.

Macrophages play a central role in host defense against invading pathogens. In this study, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: ALV-J replication is weakened from 3 hours post-infection (hpi) to 36 hpi, which was verified using Western blotting and RT-PCR. To further investigate the interaction between ALV-J and macrophages, transcriptome analysis was performed to analyze the host genes’ function in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Compared to the uninfected control, 624 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEG) and 341 down-regulated DEG at 3 hpi, and 174 up-regulated DEG and 87 down-regulated DEG at 36 hpi were identified in chicken MDM, respectively. ALV-J infection induced strong innate immune responses in chicken MDM at 3 hpi, instead of 36 hpi, according to the analysis results of Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway. Importantly, the host factors, such as up-regulated MIP-3α, IL-1β, iNOS, K60, IRG1, CH25H, NFKBIZ, lysozyme and OASL were involved in the host defense response during the course of ALV-J infection. On the contrary, up-regulated EX-FABP, IL4I1, COX-2, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3 and the Jak STAT pathway inhibitors including CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3 are beneficial to ALV-J survival in chicken macrophages. We speculated that ALV-J tropism for macrophages helps to establish a latent infection in chicken MDM from 6 to 36 hpi. The present study provides a comprehensive view of the interactions between macrophages and ALV-J. It suggests the mechanisms of defense of chicken macrophages against ALV-J invasion and how ALV-J escape the host innate immune responses.

Also, host co-infection by different pathogens may have important consequences for the evolution of hosts and pathogens, and host-pathogen co-evolution. Hence it is of interest to know if the distribution of pathogens over their host range is random, or if there are associations between hosts and pathogens, or between pathogens sharing a host. To analyse these issues we propose indices for the observed patterns of host infection by pathogens, and for the observed patterns of co-infection, and tests to analyse if these patterns conform to randomness or reflect associations. Applying these tests to the prevalence of five plant viruses on 21 wild plant species evidenced host-virus associations: most hosts and viruses were selective for viruses and hosts, respectively. Interestingly, the more host-selective viruses were the more prevalent ones, suggesting that host specialisation is a successful strategy for multi-host pathogens. Analyses also showed that viruses tended to associate positively in co-infected hosts. The developed indices and tests provide the tools to analyse how strong and common are these associations among different groups of pathogens, which will help to understand and model the population biology of multi-host pathogens.",2006-12-20,"Malpica, José M.; Sacristán, Soledad; Fraile, Aurora; García-Arenal, Fernando",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c64f525d77bf8b2ae4439a875f1bd8eb197a0519.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1762347.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1762347/,

In the present study, we evaluate a TaqMan protocol using two identically labelled hydrolysis probes (simple, LNA (locked-nucleic-acid)) and MGB (minor-groove-binder) modified probes and combinations thereof in a single assay. Our results based on a synthetic amplicon suggest that the second probe does not compromise the TaqMan qPCR/RT-qPCR parameters, which repeatedly and reproducibly remained comparable to those of the corresponding single-probe assays, irrespective of the relative probe orientation, whether opposite or tandem, and probe modifications or combinations thereof. On the other hand, the second probe additively contributed to the overall fluorescence signal. The utility of the dual-probe approach was demonstrated on practical examples by using field specimens.

This study investigated knowledge, attitudes and practices of LPTs relating to influenza A (H7N9). METHODS: Using multi-stage cluster sampling, 306 LPTs were interviewed in Guangzhou by a standardized questionnaire between mid-May to June, 2013. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with preventive practices and attitudes towards various control measures implemented in live poultry markets against H7N9. RESULTS: Only 46.1% of the respondents recognized risks associated with contacts with bird secretions or droppings, and only 22.9% perceived personally ""likely/very likely"" to contract H7N9 infection. Around 60% of the respondents complied with hand-washing and wearing gloves, and only 20% reported wearing face masks. Only 16.3% of the respondents agreed on introducing central slaughtering of poultry. Being younger, involving in slaughtering poultry, having longer working hours, less access to H7N9-related information and poorer knowledge, and perceiving lower personal susceptibility to H7N9 infection were negatively associated with preventive practices. Comparing with previous studies conducted when human cases of H5N1 avian influenza infection was first identified in Guangdong, LPTs' perceived susceptibility to novel influenza viruses increased significantly but acceptance for central slaughtering of poultry remained low. CONCLUSIONS: Information on avian influenza provided through multiple communication tools may be necessary to promote knowledge among poultry traders. Familiarity with risk may have led to the lower perceived vulnerability to avian influenza and less protective actions among the LPTs particularly for those involving more risky exposure to live poultry. Reasons for the consistently low acceptance for central slaughtering of poultry await further exploration.

There continue to be sporadic flare-ups of EVD cases in West Africa. EVD presentation is nonspecific and characterized initially by onset of fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, and fever; this is followed several days later by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Anorexia and gastrointestinal losses lead to dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and metabolic acidosis, and, in some patients, acute kidney injury. Hypoxia and ventilation failure occurs most often with severe illness and may be exacerbated by substantial fluid requirements for intravascular volume repletion and some degree of systemic capillary leak. Although minor bleeding manifestations are common, hypovolemic and septic shock complicated by multisystem organ dysfunction appear the most frequent causes of death. Males and females have been equally affected, with children (0–14 years of age) accounting for 19 %, young adults (15–44 years) 58 %, and older adults (≥45 years) 23 % of reported cases. While the current case fatality proportion in West Africa is approximately 40 %, it has varied substantially over time (highest near the outbreak onset) according to available resources (40–90 % mortality in West Africa compared to under 20 % in Western Europe and the USA), by age (near universal among neonates and high among older adults), and by Ebola viral load at admission. While there is no Ebola virus-specific therapy proven to be effective in clinical trials, mortality has been dramatically lower among EVD patients managed with supportive intensive care in highly resourced settings, allowing for the avoidance of hypovolemia, correction of electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, and the provision of oxygen, ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis when indicated. This experience emphasizes that, in addition to evaluating specific medical treatments, improving the global capacity to provide supportive critical care to patients with EVD may be the greatest opportunity to improve patient outcomes.

These include Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) that can cause disseminated or persistent localized infections. To define the precise structural features that determine the binding of distinct pathogens with CEACAMs, we have undertaken molecular modelling and mutation of the receptor molecules at previously implicated key target residues required for bacterial binding. These include Ser-32, Tyr-34, Val-39, Gln-44 and Gln-89, in addition to Ile-91, the primary docking site for the pathogens. Most, but not all, of these residues located adjacent to each other in a previous N-domain model of human CEACAM1, which was based on REI, CD2 and CD4. In the current studies, we have refined this model based on the mouse CEACAM1 crystal structure, and observe that all of the above residues form an exposed continuous binding region on the N-domain. Examination of the model also suggested that substitution of two of these residues 34 and 89 could affect the accessibility of Ile-91 for ligand binding. By introducing selected mutations at the positions 91, 34 and 89, we confirmed the primary importance of Ile-91 in all bacterial binding to CEACAM1 despite the inter- and intraspecies structural differences between the bacterial CEACAM-binding ligands. The studies further indicated that the efficiency of binding was significantly enhanced for specific strains by mutations such as Y34F and Q89N, which also altered the hierarchy of Nm versus Hi strain binding. These studies imply that distinct polymorphisms in human epithelial CEACAMs have the potential to decrease or increase the risk of infection by the receptor-targeting pathogens.",2007-02-01,"Villullas, Silvia; Hill, Darryl J; Sessions, Richard B; Rea, Jon; Virji, Mumtaz",Cell Microbiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6ea2532aacbdcea4609067523e9e72fa8cd73200.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1859983.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1859983/,

Here, we provide an updated molecular characterization of the CPV 2 circulating in Taiwan. METHODS: In this study, 28 isolates of CPV 2 from 144 dogs with suspected CPV infection were obtained from northern, central, and southern Taiwan from 2008 to 2012 and screened by PCR.

Compared to the reference CPV 2a, all 15 of the CPV 2a sequences collected in this study contain an Ile324 mutation caused by a TAT to ATT mutation at nucleotides 970–972 of the VP2 gene. CONCLUSION: Our VP2 sequence data revealed that both types are currently prevalent CPV 2 field strains circulating in Taiwan, and a unique Ile324 VP2 mutation was found in our Taiwanese CPV 2a isolates and recent Asian isolates.

The potential inverse relation of HDL to coronary artery disease (CAD) and the effects of HDL on myriad other inflammatory conditions warrant a better understanding of the genetic basis of the HDL proteome. We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of the regulation of the proteome of HDL isolated from a panel of 100 diverse inbred strains of mice (the hybrid mouse diversity panel) and examined protein composition and efflux capacity to identify novel factors that affect the HDL proteome. Genetic analysis revealed widely varied HDL protein levels across the strains. Some of this variation was explained by local cis-acting regulation, termed cis-protein quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Variations in apoA-II and apoC-3 affected the abundance of multiple HDL proteins, indicating a coordinated regulation. We identified modules of covarying proteins and defined a protein-protein interaction network that describes the protein composition of the naturally occurring subspecies of HDL in mice. Sterol efflux capacity varied up to 3-fold across the strains, and HDL proteins displayed distinct correlation patterns with macrophage and ABCA1-specific cholesterol efflux capacity and cholesterol exchange, suggesting that subspecies of HDL participate in discrete functions. The baseline and stimulated sterol efflux capacity phenotypes were associated with distinct QTLs with smaller effect size, suggesting a multigenetic regulation. Our results highlight the complexity of HDL particles by revealing the high degree of heterogeneity and intercorrelation, some of which is associated with functional variation, and support the concept that HDL-cholesterol alone is not an accurate measure of HDL’s properties, such as protection against CAD.",2019-01-08,"Pamir, Nathalie; Pan, Calvin; Plubell, Deanna L.; Hutchins, Patrick M.; Tang, Chongren; Wimberger, Jake; Irwin, Angela; Vallim, Thomas Q. de Aguiar; Heinecke, Jay W.; Lusis, Aldons J.",J Lipid Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e5d7b78cf1acf78071a1b54e6f4fe6dd68ac9430.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6399512.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6399512/,

The aim was to provide health authorities in New Zealand with evidence-based practical information to guide the development and delivery of effective health messages for H1N1 and other health campaigns. This study contributed to the initiative by providing qualitative data about community responses to key health messages in the 2009 and 2010 H1N1 campaigns, the impact of messages on behavioural change and the differential impact on vulnerable groups in New Zealand. METHODS: Qualitative data were collected on community responses to key health messages in the 2009 and 2010 Ministry of Health H1N1 campaigns, the impact of messages on behaviour and the differential impact on vulnerable groups. Eight focus groups were held in the winter of 2010 with 80 participants from groups identified by the Ministry of Health as vulnerable to the H1N1 virus, such as people with chronic health conditions, pregnant women, children, Pacific Peoples and Māori. Because this study was part of a rapid response initiative, focus groups were selected as the most efficient means of data collection in the time available. For Māori, focus group discussion (hui) is a culturally appropriate methodology. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of data identified four major themes: personal and community risk, building community strategies, responsibility and information sources. People wanted messages about specific actions that they could take to protect themselves and their families and to mitigate any consequences. They wanted transparent and factual communication where both good and bad news is conveyed by people who they could trust. CONCLUSIONS: The responses from all groups endorsed the need for community based risk management including information dissemination. Engaging with communities will be essential to facilitate preparedness and build community resilience to future pandemic events. This research provides an illustration of the complexities of how people understand and respond to health messages related to the H1N1 pandemic.

One group is lectins. Ipomoelin (IPO) is one of the wound-inducible proteins of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas cv. Tainung 57) and is a Jacalin-related lectin (JRL). In this study, we resolved the crystal structures of IPO in its apo form and in complex with carbohydrates such as methyl α-D-mannopyranoside (Me-Man), methyl α-D-glucopyranoside (Me-Glc), and methyl α-D-galactopyranoside (Me-Gal) in different space groups. The packing diagrams indicated that IPO might represent a compact tetrameric association in the JRL family. The protomer of IPO showed a canonical β-prism fold with 12 strands of β-sheets but with 2 additional short β-strands at the N terminus. A truncated IPO (ΔN10IPO) by removing the 2 short β-strands of the N terminus was used to reveal its role in a tetrameric association. Gel filtration chromatography confirmed IPO as a tetrameric form in solution. Isothermal titration calorimetry determined the binding constants (K(A)) of IPO and ΔN10IPO against various carbohydrates. IPO could bind to Me-Man, Me-Glc, and Me-Gal with similar binding constants. In contrast, ΔN10IPO showed high binding ability to Me-Man and Me-Glc but could not bind to Me-Gal. Our structural and functional analysis of IPO revealed that its compact tetrameric association and carbohydrate binding polyspecificity could be regulated by the 2 additional N-terminal β-strands.

Present stochastic strategies are mainly evaluated based on classical network models, such as scale-free networks and small-world networks, and thus are insufficient. Three frequently referred stochastic immunization strategies—acquaintance immunization, community-bridge immunization, and ring vaccination—were analyzed in this work. The optimal immunization ratios for acquaintance immunization and community-bridge immunization strategies were investigated, and the effectiveness of these three strategies in controlling the spreading of epidemics were analyzed based on realistic social contact networks. The results show all the strategies have decreased the coverage of the epidemics compared to baseline scenario (no control measures). However the effectiveness of acquaintance immunization and community-bridge immunization are very limited, with acquaintance immunization slightly outperforming community-bridge immunization. Ring vaccination significantly outperforms acquaintance immunization and community-bridge immunization, and the sensitivity analysis shows it could be applied to controlling the epidemics with a wide infectivity spectrum.

Here we analyzed the effects of apilimod, a PIKfyve inhibitor that was reported to be well tolerated in humans in phase 2 clinical trials, for its effects on entry and infection of EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV). We first found that apilimod blocks infections by EBOV and MARV in Huh 7, Vero E6 and primary human macrophage cells, with notable potency in the macrophages (IC(50), 10 nM). We next observed that similar doses of apilimod block EBOV-glycoprotein-virus like particle (VLP) entry and transcription-replication competent VLP infection, suggesting that the primary mode of action of apilimod is as an entry inhibitor, preventing release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. After providing evidence that the anti-EBOV action of apilimod is via PIKfyve, we showed that it blocks trafficking of EBOV VLPs to endolysosomes containing Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), the intracellular receptor for EBOV. Concurrently apilimod caused VLPs to accumulate in early endosome antigen 1-positive endosomes. We did not detect any effects of apilimod on bulk endosome acidification, on the activity of cathepsins B and L, or on cholesterol export from endolysosomes. Hence by antagonizing PIKfyve, apilimod appears to block EBOV trafficking to its site of fusion and entry into the cytoplasm.

In an effort to determine if this phenomenon is specific to the rat or applicable to other species, we compared the ontogenic changes in hepatic and renal angiotensinogen mRNA expression in fetal (60, 90, 118, and 138 d of gestation, term being 145 d), newborn (7 d postnatal), and adult sheep. Total RNA was extracted, subjected to Northern blotting and hybridized using a full-length rat radiolabeled antisense RNA. Angiotensinogen mRNA sequences were detected in all fetal liver samples and appeared to increase 3-fold from 60 to 138 d gestation and then to decrease after birth. In contrast, angiotensiogen mRNA could not be detected in renal cortical tissue of 118 or 138 d fetuses, or newborn or adult sheep. We conclude that, unlike in the rat, liver angiotensinogen gene expression is detectable during the 2nd trimester of gestation in sheep and is developmentally regulated. Furthermore, in contrast to the fetal rat, angiotensinogen mRNA sequences were undetectable in fetal sheep kidney.",1990,"Olson, Ann Louise; Perlman, Stanley; Robillard, Jean E",Pediatr Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7d9b16764bee617ddc4ce0a17a257c22204411a2.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086511/,

We report here that injection of naked β-globin untranslated region (UTR)-stabilized mRNA coding for β-galactosidase is followed by detectable translation in vivo.

Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses contribute to virus elimination; however, to date, HLA class I allele-restricted HTNV glycoprotein (GP) epitopes recognized by CTLs have not been reported, limiting our understanding of CTL responses against HTNV infection in humans. In this study, 34 HTNV GP nine-mer epitopes that may bind to HLA-A*0201 molecules were predicted using the BIMAS and SYFPEITHI database. Seven of the epitopes were demonstrated to bind to HLA-A*0201 molecules with high affinity via the T2 cell binding assay and were successfully used to synthesize peptide/HLA-A*0201 tetramers. The results of tetramer staining showed that the frequencies of each epitope-specific CTL were higher in patients with milder HFRS, which indicated that the epitopes may induce protective CTL responses after HTNV infection. IFN-γ-enzyme-linked immunospot analysis further confirmed the immunoreactivity of epitopes by eliciting epitope-specific IFN-γ-producing CTL responses. In an HTNV challenge trial, significant inhibition of HTNV replication characterized by lower levels of antigens and RNA loads was observed in major target organs (liver, spleen, and kidneys) of HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic mice pre-vaccinated with nonapeptides VV9 (aa8–aa16, VMASLVWPV), SL9 (aa996–aa1004, SLTECPTFL) and LL9 (aa358–aa366, LIWTGMIDL). Importantly, LL9 exhibited the best ability to induce protective CTL responses and showed a prominent effect on the kidneys, potentially preventing kidney injury after HTNV infection. Taken together, our results highlight that HTNV GP-derived HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes could elicit protective CTL responses against the virus, and that epitope LL9 functions as an immunodominant protective epitope that may advance the design of safe and effective CTL-based HTNV peptide vaccines for humans.",2017-12-12,"Tang, Kang; Cheng, Linfeng; Zhang, Chunmei; Zhang, Yusi; Zheng, Xuyang; Zhang, Yun; Zhuang, Ran; Jin, Boquan; Zhang, Fanglin; Ma, Ying",Front Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/18f3b3f9f77227f4941079cdb605af4e5777c061.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5732971.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5732971/,

J. rigida from Jilin (S9, S10) and Liaoning (S11) exhibited the highest contents of phenolic profiles (total phenolics, total flavonoids and 10 phenolic compounds) and the strongest antioxidant and antibacterial activities, followed by Shaanxi (S2, S3). A similarity analysis (SA) demonstrated substantial similarities in fingerprint chromatograms, from which 14 common peaks were selected. The similarity values varied from 0.85 to 0.98. Chemometrics techniques, including hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA), were further applied to facilitate accurate classification and quantification of the J. rigida samples derived from the 11 regions. The results supported HPLC data showing that all J. rigida samples exhibit considerable variations in phenolic profiles, and the samples were further clustered into three major groups coincident with their geographical regions of origin. In addition, two discriminant functions with a 100% discrimination ratio were constructed to further distinguish and classify samples with unknown membership on the basis of eigenvalues to allow optimal discrimination among the groups.

We investigated the presence of E. coli in tissue samples (liver, lung and intestines) collected from 50 fruit bats of five different species (Eidolon helvum, Epomops franqueti, Hypsignathus monstrosus, Myonycteris torquata, Rousettus aegyptiacus) of two different areas in the Republic of Congo between 2009 and 2010. To assess E. coli pathotypes and phylogenetic relationships, we determined the presence of 59 virulence associated genes and multilocus sequence types (STs). Isolates were further tested for their susceptibility to several antimicrobial substances by agar disk diffusion test and for the presence of an Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase phenotype. E. coli was detected in 60% of the bats analysed. The diversity of E. coli strains was very high, with 37 different STs within 40 isolates. Occasionally, we detected sequence types (e.g. ST69, ST127, and ST131) and pathotypes (e.g. ExPEC, EPEC and atypical EPEC), which are known pathogens in human and/or animal infections. Although the majority of strains were assigned to phylogenetic group B2 (46.2%), which is linked with the ExPEC pathovar, occurrence of virulence-associated genes in these strains were unexpectedly low. Due to this, and as only few of the E. coli isolates showed intermediate resistance to certain antimicrobial substances, we assume a rather naïve E. coli population, lacking contact to humans or domestic animals.

Gankeshuangqing dispersible tablets (GKSQDT) which have a good effect on treating AURTIs. GKSQDT is composed of baicalin and andrographolide. However, its severe bitterness limits application of patients. Due to the addition of plentiful accessories, common masking methods are unsuitable for GKSQDT. It is thus necessary to develop a new masking method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Previous study showed that baicalin was less bitter than andrographolide. Thus, particle coating technology was adapted to prepare composite particles that baicalin coated on the surface of andrographolide to decrease bitterness. Initially, particle size of baicalin and coating time of composite was investigated to prepare composite. Then, scanning electron microscopy, wettability, and infrared (IR) spectrogram were used to characterize the microstructure of composite. Furthermore, electronic tongue test, animal preference experiment, and human sensory test were applied to evaluate the masking effect. RESULTS: To produce composite, baicalin should be ground in vibromill for 6 min. Then, andrographolide fine powder was added to grind together for 6 min. Contact angle of composite was smaller than mixture, and more similar to baicalin. Other physical characterization including microstructure, wettability, and IR also suggested that andrographolide was successfully coated by baicalin superfine. Furthermore, taste-masking test indicated taste-masked tablets was less bitter than original tablets. CONCLUSION: The study indicated that particle coating technology can be used for taste masking of GKSQDT without adding other substance. Moreover, it provides a new strategy of taste masking for national medicine. SUMMARY: A new strategy to mask bitterness without adding any other substance based on coating technology was provided. The masking effect was confirmed by electronic tongue test, animal preference experiment and human sensory test.

In this study, we analyzed six chitin-binding lectins, DSA, LEL, PWM, STL, UDA, and WGA, by quantitative frontal affinity chromatography. Some novel features were evident: WGA showed almost comparable affinity for pyridylaminated chitotriose and chitotetraose, while LEL and UDA showed much weaker affinity, and DSA, PWM, and STL had no substantial affinity for the former. WGA showed selective affinity for hybrid-type N-glycans harboring a bisecting GlcNAc residue. UDA showed extensive binding to high-mannose type N-glycans, with affinity increasing with the number of Man residues. DSA showed the highest affinity for highly branched N-glycans consisting of type II LacNAc (N-acetyllactosamine). Further, multivalent features of these lectins were investigated by using glycoconjugate and lectin microarrays. The lectins showed substantial binding to immobilized LacNAc as well as chito-oligosaccharides, although the extents to which they bound varied among them.

The renal response to persistent leptospiral colonization, as measured by urinary protein biosignatures, has not been systematically studied. Urinary exosomes--bioactive membrane-bound nanovesicles--contain cell-state specific cargo that additively reflect formation all along the nephron. We hypothesized that Leptospira-infection will alter the content of urine exosomes, and further, that these Leptospira-induced alterations will hold clues to unravel novel pathways related to bacterial-host interactions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Exosome protein content from 24 hour urine samples of Leptospira-infected rats was compared with that of uninfected rats using SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Statistical models were used to identify significantly dysregulated proteins in Leptospira-infected and uninfected rat urine exosomes. In all, 842 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS proteomics of total rat urine and 204 proteins associated specifically with exosomes. Multivariate analysis showed that 25 proteins significantly discriminated between uninfected control and infected rats. Alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase, also known as CD13 topped this list with the highest score, a finding we validated by Western immunoblotting. Whole urine analysis showed Tamm-Horsfall protein level reduction in the infected rat urine. Total urine and exosome proteins were significantly different in male vs. female infected rats. CONCLUSIONS: We identified exosome-associated renal tubule-specific responses to Leptospira infection in a rat chronic colonization model.

Initial methods included screening donors for travel histories to banned areas and for high‐risk behaviors, but pathogen‐specific assays performed at the collection and manufacturing sites also have become key factors in assuring blood safety. Many of these have focused on donor and laboratory‐based screening for transfusion‐transmitted diseases, as evidenced by the hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus screening in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.

Since infertility is a major concern following chemotherapy, it is important to characterize the drug-specific damage to the reproductive system to help find appropriate protective strategies. This study investigates the damage on neonatal mouse ovary maintained in vitro for 6 days, and exposed for 24 h (on Day 2) to clinically relevant doses of Docetaxel (DOC; low: 0.1 µM, mid: 1 µM, high: 10 µM). Furthermore, the study explores the putative protective action exerted by Tri-iodothyronine (T3; 10(−7) M). At the end of culture, morphological analyses and follicle counts showed that DOC negatively impacts on early growing follicles, decreasing primary follicle number and severely affecting health at the transitional and primary stages. Poor follicle health was mainly due to effects on granulosa cells, indicating that the effects of DOC on oocytes were likely to be secondary to granulosa cell damage. DOC damages growing follicles specifically, with no direct effect on the primordial follicle reserve. Immunostaining and western blotting showed that DOC induces activation of intrinsic, type II apoptosis in ovarian somatic cells; increasing the levels of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 8, Bax and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, while also inducing movement of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol. T3 did not prevent the damage induced by the low dose of DOC. These results demonstrated that DOC induces a gonadotoxic effect on the mouse ovary through induction of somatic cell apoptosis, with no evidence of direct effects on the oocyte, and that the damaging effect is not mitigated by T3.",2014-07-30,"Lopes, Federica; Smith, Rowena; Anderson, Richard A.; Spears, Norah",Mol Hum Reprod,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f33e644d058bc8373378c115878be06346298687.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4172173.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172173/,

Surprisingly, we find that avirulent type III parasites are preferentially cleared in naive macrophages, independent of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) activation. The ability of naive macrophages to clear type III parasites was dependent on enhanced activity of NADPH oxidase (Nox)-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induction of guanylate binding protein 5 (Gbp5). Macrophages infected with type III parasites (CTG strain) showed a time-dependent increase in intracellular ROS generation that was higher than that induced by type I parasites (GT1 strain). The absence of Nox1 or Nox2, gp91 subunit isoforms of the Nox complex, reversed ROS-mediated clearance of CTG parasites. Consistent with this finding, both Nox1(−/−) and Nox2(−/−) mice showed higher susceptibility to CTG infection than wild-type mice. Additionally, Gbp5 expression was induced upon infection and the enhanced clearance of CTG strain parasites was reversed in Gbp5(−/−) macrophages. Expression of a type I ROP18 allele in CTG prevented clearance in naive macrophages, suggesting that it plays a role counteracting Gbp5. Although ROS and Gbp5 have been linked to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, clearance of CTG parasites did not rely on induction of pyroptosis. Collectively, these findings reveal that not all strains of T. gondii are adept at avoiding clearance in macrophages and define new roles for ROS and Gbps in controlling this important intracellular pathogen.",2018-08-28,"Matta, Sumit K.; Patten, Kelley; Wang, Quiling; Kim, Bae-Hoon; MacMicking, John D.; Sibley, L.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data and outcomes of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients (severe to critical) during Jan-2011 to Feb-2018 from five hospitals, followed by a systematic analysis of cases from 2017 to 2018 (n = 289) and all previous epidemics during 2011–2017 (n = 169). RESULTS: In-hospital fatality was over 5-folds higher during the 2017–2018 (p < 0.01) in which 19 patients died (6.6%), whereas only 2 mortalities (1.2%) were observed during 2011–2017. Of the 289 hospitalized in 2017–2018, 153 were confirmed with influenza B virus, 110 with A/H1N1pdm09, and 26 A/H3N2, whereas A/H1N1pdm09 was the predominant cause of hospitalization in previous seasons combined (45%). Fatal cases in 2017–2018 were exclusively associated with either influenza B or A/H1N1pdm09. Our results show that a significant lower proportion of patients aged 14 or greater were treated with oseltamivir, during the 2017–2018 epidemic, and exhibited higher levels of clinical severity. CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital fatality rate might be significantly higher in the 2017–2018 season in China. A sufficient supply of oseltamivir and antiviral therapy within 48 h from onset could reduce fatality rates.

METHODS: A nationwide representative sample of 2,000 Japanese aged 20 or older was asked about their perception and level of concern about various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention, as a part of an Omnibus Survey. Interviews were conducted with 1,355 subjects (609 men and 746 women). RESULTS: Among 12 risk factor candidates, the attributable fraction of cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection was considered highest (51%), followed by that of tobacco smoking (43%), stress (39%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37%). On the other hand, the attributable fractions of cancer by charred fish and meat (21%) and alcohol drinking (22%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. For most risk factors, attributable fraction responses were higher in women than in men. As a whole, the subjects tended to respond with higher values than those estimated by epidemiologic evidence in the West. The attributable fraction of cancer speculated to be genetically determined was 32%, while 36% of cancer was considered preventable by improving lifestyle.

POWV lineage II, also known as deer tick virus, is the strain of the virus most frequently found in Ixodes scapularis ticks and is implicated in most cases of POWV encephalitis in the United States. Currently, no commercial tests are available to detect POWV exposure in tick-borne disease (TBD) patients. We describe here the development and analytical validation of a serologic test panel to detect POWV infections. The panel uses an indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to screen. EIA-positive samples reflex to a laboratory-developed, POWV-specific immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The analytical sensitivity of the test panel was 89%, and the limit of detection was a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) titer of 1:20. The analytical specificity was 100% for the IgM assay and 65% for the IgG assay when heterologous-flavivirus-positive samples were tested. On samples collected from regions where Lyme disease is endemic, seroprevalence for POWV in TBD samples was 9.4% (10 of 106) versus 2% when tested with non-TBD samples (2 of 100, P = 0.034). No evidence of POWV infection was seen in samples collected from a region where Lyme disease was not endemic (0 of 22). This test panel provides a sensitive and specific platform for detecting a serologic response to POWV early in the course of infection when neutralizing antibodies may not be detectable. Combined with clinical history, the panel is an effective tool for identifying acute POWV infection. IMPORTANCE Approximately 100 cases of POWV disease were reported in the United States over the past 10 years. Most cases have occurred in the Northeast (52) and Great Lakes (45) regions (https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/statistics.html). The prevalence of POWV in ticks and mammals is increasing, and POWV poses an increasing threat in a greater geographical range. In areas of the Northeast and Midwest where Lyme disease is endemic, POWV testing is recommended for patients with a recent tick bite, patients with Lyme disease who have been treated with antibiotics, or patients with a tick exposure who have tested negative for Lyme disease or other tick-borne illnesses and have persistent symptoms consistent with posttreatment Lyme disease. Testing could also benefit patients with tick exposure and unexplained neurologic symptoms and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients with known tick exposure. Until now, diagnostic testing for Powassan virus has not been commercially available and has been limited to patients presenting with severe, neurologic complications. The lack of routine testing for Powassan virus in patients with suspected tick-borne disease means that little information is available regarding the overall prevalence of the virus and the full spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with infection. As Ixodes scapularis is the tick vector for Powassan virus and multiple other tick-borne pathogens, including the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, the clinical presentations and long-term outcomes of Powassan virus infection and concurrent infection with other tick-borne disease pathogens remain unknown.",2018-01-10,"Thomm, Angela M.; Schotthoefer, Anna M.; Dupuis, Alan P.; Kramer, Laura D.; Frost, Holly M.; Fritsche, Thomas R.; Harrington, Yvette A.; Knox, Konstance K.; Kehl, Sue C.",mSphere,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/36dce9f7118e056798289b0019752f51e83568d9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5760746.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5760746/,

Influenza-related mortality has been variously ascribed to an ineffective host response that fails to limit viral replication, an excessive host inflammatory response that results in lung injury and impairment of gas exchange, or to bacterial superinfection. We sought to determine whether lung inflammation promoted or impaired host survival in influenza pneumonia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To distinguish among these possible causes of influenza-related death, we induced robust lung inflammation by exposing mice to an aerosolized bacterial lysate prior to challenge with live virus. The treatment induced expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 8- and 40-fold greater, respectively, than that caused by lethal influenza infection. Yet, this augmented inflammation was associated with striking resistance to host mortality (0% vs 90% survival, p = 0.0001) and reduced viral titers (p = 0.004). Bacterial superinfection of virus infected lungs was not observed. When mice were repeatedly exposed to the bacterial lysate, as would be clinically desirable during an influenza epidemic, there was no tachyphylaxis of the induced viral resistance. When the bacterial lysate was administered after the viral challenge, there was still some mortality benefit, and when ribavirin was added to the aerosolized bacterial lysate, host survival was synergistically improved (0% vs 93.3% survival, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data indicate that innate immune resistance to influenza can be effectively stimulated, and suggest that ineffective rather than excessive inflammation is the major cause of mortality in influenza pneumonia.",2009-01-12,"Tuvim, Michael J.; Evans, Scott E.; Clement, Cecilia G.; Dickey, Burton F.; Gilbert, Brian E.",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/eb83b27bafc37b40794c2c7cc1b921cbcdb4138c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2613561.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2613561/,

Widespread resistance to both classes of influenza antivirals (adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors) occurs in both pandemic and seasonal viruses, rendering these drugs to be of marginal utility in the treatment modality. Worldwide, virtually all 2009 H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 strains are resistant to the adamantanes (rimantadine and amantadine), and the majority of seasonal H1N1 strains are resistant to oseltamivir, the most widely prescribed neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI). To address the need for more effective therapy, we evaluated the in vitro activity of a triple combination antiviral drug (TCAD) regimen composed of drugs with different mechanisms of action against drug-resistant seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses. Amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir, alone and in combination, were tested against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant influenza A viruses using an in vitro infection model in MDCK cells. Our data show that the triple combination was highly synergistic against drug-resistant viruses, and the synergy of the triple combination was significantly greater than the synergy of any double combination tested (P<0.05), including the combination of two NAIs. Surprisingly, amantadine and oseltamivir contributed to the antiviral activity of the TCAD regimen against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant viruses, respectively, at concentrations where they had no activity as single agents, and at concentrations that were clinically achievable. Our data demonstrate that the TCAD regimen composed of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir is highly synergistic against resistant viruses, including 2009 H1N1.

Using primer walking, we sequenced the nearly complete genomes of two highly divergent bocaviruses we provisionally named porcine bocavirus 1 isolate H18 (PBoV1-H18) and porcine bocavirus 2 isolate A6 (PBoV2-A6) which differed by 51.8% in their NS1 protein. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PBoV1-H18 was very closely related to a ∼2 Kb central region of a porcine bocavirus-like virus (PBo-LikeV) from Sweden described in 2009. PBoV2-A6 was very closely related to the porcine bocavirus genomes PBoV-1 and PBoV2 from China described in 2010. Among 340 fecal samples collected from different age, asymptomatic swine in five Chinese provinces, the prevalence of PBoV1-H18 and PBoV2-A6 related viruses were 45–75% and 55–70% respectively, with 30–47% of pigs co-infected. PBoV1-A6 related strains were highly conserved, while PBoV2-H18 related strains were more diverse, grouping into two genotypes corresponding to the previously described PBoV1 and PBoV2. Together with the recently described partial bocavirus genomes labeled V6 and V7, a total of three major porcine bocavirus clades have therefore been described to date. Further studies will be required to elucidate the possible pathogenic impact of these diverse bocaviruses either alone or in combination with other porcine viruses.",2011-04-15,"Shan, Tongling; Lan, Daoliang; Li, Linlin; Wang, Chunmei; Cui, Li; Zhang, Wen; Hua, Xiuguo; Zhu, Caixia; Zhao, Wei; Delwart, Eric",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/21caf0c49864b6af4c62e68e3ff7374e14c16537.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3078135.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078135/,

Here, we make use of mathematical models to consider the case of partner notification for sexually transmitted infection, however these models are sufficiently simple to allow more general conclusions to be drawn. We show that, when contact network structure is considered in addition to contact tracing, standard “mass action” models are generally inadequate. To consider the impact of mutual contacts (specifically clustering) we develop an improvement to existing pairwise network models, which we use to demonstrate that ceteris paribus, clustering improves the efficacy of contact tracing for a large region of parameter space. This result is sometimes reversed, however, for the case of highly effective contact tracing. We also develop stochastic simulations for comparison, using simple re-wiring methods that allow the generation of appropriate comparator networks.

Key challenges include mounting dissemination of multiple resistances to antibiotics, the easy transmission and the growing mortality rates of hospital-acquired bacterial diseases. Thus, new ways to rapidly detect these infections are vital. Consequently, researchers around the globe pursue innovative approaches for point-of-care devices. In many cases the specific interaction of an antigen and a corresponding antibody is pivotal. However, the knowledge about suitable antigens is lacking. The aim of this study was to identify novel antigens as specific diagnostic markers. Additionally, these proteins might be aptly used for the generation of vaccines to improve current treatment options. Hence, a cDNA-based expression library was constructed and screened via microarrays to detect novel antigens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a prominent agent of nosocomial infections well-known for its extensive antibiotics resistance, especially by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). After screening 1536 clones, 14 previously unknown immunogenic proteins were identified. Subsequently, each protein was expressed in full-length and its immunodominant character examined by ELISA and microarray analyses. Consequently, six proteins were selected for epitope mapping and three thereof possessed linear epitopes. After specificity analysis, homology survey and 3d structural modelling, one epitope sequence GAVVALSTTFA of KPN_00363, an ion channel protein, was identified harboring specificity for K. pneumoniae. The remaining epitopes showed ambiguous results regarding the specificity for K. pneumoniae. The approach adopted herein has been successfully utilized to discover novel antigens of Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica antigens before. Now, we have transferred this knowledge to the key nosocomial agent, K. pneumoniae. By identifying several novel antigens and their linear epitope sites, we have paved the way for crucial future research and applications including the design of point-of-care devices, vaccine development and serological screenings for a highly relevant nosocomial pathogen.",2014-10-21,"Hoppe, Sebastian; Bier, Frank F.; von Nickisch-Rosenegk, Markus",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ba2f1457928b26ae7f4ad64983bac74a4e383378.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4205017.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4205017/,

The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy. Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing. This shortcoming appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be shared by many other IBV genotypes and pathogens in general.",2018-12-20,"Franzo, Giovanni; Cecchinato, Mattia; Tosi, Giovanni; Fiorentini, Laura; Faccin, Francesca; Tucciarone, Claudia Maria; Trogu, Tiziana; Barbieri, Ilaria; Massi, Paola; Moreno, Ana",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6cfa11e4308af9ef83f7800b45f011139915cd43.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6301571.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6301571/,

This was most probably the result of intragenic recombination. High levels of sequence divergence and significantly more nonsynonymous than synonymous substitutions (d(N)/d(S)>1) suggest long-term balancing selection.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective pilot study, a level III neonatal and pediatric intensive care unit at a University children's Hospital. PATIENTS: We studied 22 ventilated pediatric (n = 15) and neonatal (n = 7) intensive care patients (aged 3 days–16 years). Inclusion criteria were mechanical ventilation and signs of at least one additional organ dysfunction (cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, hematological, or renal). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Serum concentrations of the adhesion molecules were analyzed on the day of maximum organ dysfunction score and were quantitated by a sandwich ELISA technique. The overall mortality rate was 36% (8/22). Dysfunction of three or more organ systems was defined as MODS and was associated with a significant increase in VCAM-1 serum levels relative to dysfunction of three or fewer organ systems [median 1239 ng/ml (IQR 928–1615) vs. 766 ng/ml (644–915)]. A significant difference in E-selectin serum levels was found between organ failure of infectious (median 131 ng/ml, IQR 112–146) and noninfectious origin (68 ng/ml 49–105).

The Indian isolates were further classified into different genetic subgroups (<5% divergence). Post-1995 isolates were divided into two subgroups while a few isolates which originated in the year 2005 from Andhra Pradesh formed a separate group. These isolates were closely related to the isolates of the 1970s.

However, only a minority of them will have an HLA-identical sibling donor; unrelated donors, matched or partially mismatched, have been used successfully for patients lacking a related donor. Even though results with allogeneic transplants using unrelated donors are encouraging, the incidence of complications including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection or late graft failure is increased compared to identical sibling transplants. The combination of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) has been used as an effective preparative regimen for allogeneic transplants, however, the total dosage and dosing schedule of both the cyclophosphamide and TBI has varied significantly among studies. To decrease the rate of graft rejection and late graft failure with volunteer donors, we evaluated a preparative regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg over 4 consecutive days, days −8, −7, −6, −5) followed by fractionated TBI (1400 cGy administered in eight fractions over 4 days, days −4, −3, −2, −1). GVHD prophylaxis included FK506 and methotrexate. From July 1993 to January 1996, 43 adult patients, median age 38 years (range 18–58 years), were treated with this preparative regimen. Seventeen patients had low-risk disease and 26 had high-risk disease. Thirty-one donor/recipient pairs were matched for HLA-A, -B, and -DR by serology and molecular typing. Seven additional pairs were minor mismatched at the HLA-A or HLA-B loci. Four other donor/recipient pairs were HLA-A,-B, and -DR identical by serology but allele mismatched at either DRB1 or DQB. Forty patients were evaluable for myeloid engraftment. Engraftment occurred in all 40 patients at a median of 19 days. There were no cases of graft rejection or late graft failure. Nephrotoxicity was the primary adverse event with 26 patients (60%) experiencing a doubling of their creatinine. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease occurred in seven patients, six of whom had high-risk disease. All patients who had relapsed or refractory disease prior to BMT achieved a complete remission following BMT. Six patients transplanted for high-risk disease relapsed a median of 377 days post-BMT. None of the patients with low-risk disease have relapsed following transplant; the Kaplan–Meier survival for those patients with low-risk disease is 62% and 37% for those patients transplanted with high-risk disease (P = 0.0129). The median Karnofsky performance status is 100% (range 70–100%).

Organizational systems to protect against HAI in hospitals in Australia are relatively poorly developed. Awareness and practice of infection control by medical and other healthcare staff are often poor. These lapses in practice create significant risk for patients and staff from HAI. Excessive patient exposure to antimicrobials is another key factor in the emergence of antibiotic‐resistant bacteria and Clostridium difficile infection. Physicians must ensure that their interactions with patients are safe from the infection prevention standpoint. The critical preventative practice is hand hygiene in accord with the World Health Organization 5 moments model. Improving the use of antimicrobials, asepsis and immunization also has great importance. Hospitals should measure and feed back HAI rates to clinical teams. Physicians as leaders, role models and educators play an important part in promoting adherence to safe practices by other staff and students. They are also potentially effective system engineers who can embed safer practices in all elements of patient care and promote essential structural and organizational change. Patients and the public in general are becoming increasingly aware of the risk of infection when entering a hospital and expect their carers to adhere to safe practice.

ISEM methods presented in the chapter include all the techniques where the “solid phase principle” is essential in a way similar to other solid phase immunoassays.

In all ISEM methods, one of the components of the system is adsorbed to a solid phase. In AG-CGT, PA-CGT, and AB-CGT, one of the reagents is adsorbed to an electron microscopic grid, while in PA-CBT protein A is naturally present on the surface of a bacterium that serves as a solid support. In ISEM methods, the viruses can be statistically evaluated and numerically expressed as number of virions per unit of area, and can, therefore, be statistically evaluated. Thus, these methods optimize the results of a test by quantifying the effects of the quality of the supporting grid, the time of adsorption, the pH, the presence of salts, and the type of staining.

Results also suggested that newborn mouse brain tissue expressed much larger quantities of viral receptor proteins, compared to other tissues. In vitro studies showed that both mouse neurons and astrocytes could be infected by two CVB3 strains, pantropic CVB3 Nancy strain (CVB3N) and myocardiotropic CVB3 Woodruff strain (CVB3W).

Simultaneously, and at each dose of cocaine, unconditioned psychomotor stimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied in terms of multiple concurrent measures of spontaneous behavior and by activity patterns of locomotion. Time course studies showed that the neurochemical effects of cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p<0.001) increased accumbens synaptic concentrations of dopamine (DA) and concurrently and significantly (p<0.0001) decreased accumbens synaptic concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) in a dose response manner. Simulataneous behavioral time course studies showed that cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p<0.0001) increased ambulations (locomotor activity), fine movements (stereotypic movements of sniffing and grooming) and rearing behavior, while significantly decreasing agoraphobic behavior, as measured by a statistically significant increase in central ambulations (p<0.0001). The high dose of cocaine (40 mg/kg SC) significantly increased fine movements over those produced by the lower doses of cocaine (p<0.0002). One import of the findings is that the DA and 5-HT biogenic amine response occurs in a behavioral paradigm of psychomotor stimulation, which is a known measure of reinforcement. Another is that the biogenic amines DA and 5-HT are affected by cocaine in this reinforcement paradigm with exactly opposite directionality.

The full-length genomes, representing VEE virus antigenic subtypes I–VI, range in size from 11.3 to 11.5 kilobases, with 48–53% overall G+C contents. Size disparities result from subtype-related differences in the number and length of direct repeats in the C-terminal nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) domain coding sequence and the 3′NTR, while G+C content disparities are attributable to strain-specific variations in base composition at the wobble position of the polyprotein codons. Highly-conserved protein components and one nonconserved protein domain constitute the VEE virus replicase polyproteins. Approximately 80% of deduced nsP1 and nsP4 amino acid residues are invariant, compared to less than 20% of C-terminal nsP3 domain residues. In two enzootic strains, C-terminal nsP3 domain sequences degenerate into little more than repetitive serine-rich blocks.

Effective passive dispersal requires both the transport of propagules and the establishment of populations large enough to be detected. At a global scale, biogeographic patterns of cladoceran zooplankton species suggest that effective dispersal among continents was originally rare, but greatly increased in the past century with expanded commerce. Genetic analysis allows some reconstruction of past dispersal events. Allozyme and mitochondrial DNA comparisons among New World and Old-World populations of several exotic cladocerans have provided estimates for likely source populations of colonists, their dispersal corridors, and timing of earlier dispersal events. Detecting the Old-World tropical exotic Daphnia lumholtzi early in its invasion of North America has allowed detailed analysis of its spatial spread. Twelve years of collection records indicate a rapid invasion of reservoirs in the United States, by both regional spread and long-distance jumps to new regions. Combining landscape features with zooplankton surveys from south-central US reservoirs revealed higher colonization rates of D. lumholtzi at lower landscape positions, a result which can be explained by either greater propagule load or by higher susceptibility of these downstream reservoirs. Because invaded reservoirs provide a source of propagules for nearby floodplain ponds, the rarity of this species in ponds suggests limitation by local environments.

Prediction of severe aGvHD as early as possible is crucial to allow timely initiation of treatment. Here we report on a multicentre validation of an aGvHD-specific urinary proteomic classifier (aGvHD_MS17) in 423 patients. Samples (n=1106) were collected prospectively between day +7 and day +130 and analyzed using capillary electrophoresis coupled on-line to mass spectrometry. Integration of aGvHD_MS17 analysis with demographic and clinical variables using a logistic regression model led to correct classification of patients developing severe aGvHD 14 days before any clinical signs with 82.4% sensitivity and 77.3% specificity. Multivariate regression analysis showed that aGvHD_MS17 positivity was the only strong predictor for aGvHD grade III or IV (P<0.0001). The classifier consists of 17 peptides derived from albumin, β2-microglobulin, CD99, fibronectin and various collagen α-chains, indicating inflammation, activation of T cells and changes in the extracellular matrix as early signs of GvHD-induced organ damage. This study is currently the largest demonstration of accurate and investigator-independent prediction of patients at risk for severe aGvHD, thus allowing preemptive therapy based on proteomic profiling.

HAP2/GCS1, a TBV candidate, is critical for fertilization in Plasmodium. Here, the genetic diversity of PvHAP2 was studied in Plasmodium vivax parasite populations from the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). METHODS: Plasmodium vivax clinical isolates were collected in clinics from the China-Myanmar border region (135 samples), western Thailand (41 samples) and western Myanmar (51 samples). Near full-length Pvhap2 (nucleotides 13–2574) was amplified and sequenced from these isolates. Molecular evolution studies were conducted to evaluate the genetic diversity, selection and population differentiation. RESULTS: Sequencing of the pvhap2 gene for a total of 227 samples from the three P. vivax populations revealed limited genetic diversity of this gene in the GMS (π = 0.00036 ± 0.00003), with the highest π value observed in Myanmar (0.00053 ± 0.00009). Y133S was the dominant mutation in the China-Myanmar border (99.26%), Myanmar (100%) and Thailand (95.12%). Results of all neutrality tests were negative for all the three populations, suggesting the possible action of purifying selection. Codon-based tests identified specific codons which are under purifying or positive selections. Wright’s fixation index showed low to moderate genetic differentiation of P. vivax populations in the GMS, with F(ST) ranging from 0.04077 to 0.24833, whereas high levels of genetic differentiation were detected between the China-Myanmar border and Iran populations (F(ST) = 0.60266), and between Thailand and Iran populations (F(ST) = 0.44161). A total of 20 haplotypes were identified, with H2 being the abundant haplotype in China-Myanmar border, Myanmar and Thailand populations. Epitope mapping prediction of Pvhap2 antigen showed that high-score B-cell epitopes are located in the S307-G324, L429-P453 and V623-D637 regions. The E317K and D637N mutations located within S307-G324 and V623-D637 epitopes slightly reduced the predicted score for potential epitopes. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed a very low level of genetic diversity of pvhap2 gene among P. vivax populations in the Greater Mekong Subregion. The relative conservation of pvhap2 supports further evaluation of a Pvhap2-based TBV.

METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE (1966–August 2004) and InternationalPharmaceutical Abstracts (1970–August 2004) databases with the search terms daptomycin, LY146032, and lipopeptide antibiotics. Abstracts of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and documents submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration were also reviewed. RESULTS: Phase III study results suggest no difference in efficacy or tolerability between daptomycin 4 mg/kgIV QD and vancomycin or semisynthetic penicillins for complicated skin and skin-structure infections. Animal studies suggest daptomycin may be useful for the treatment of endocarditis. Daptomycin is not indicated for pneumonia, with poorer outcomes than conventional treatment It is available as an IV medication and exhibits 92% plasma protein binding in vitro. In healthy adult humans, daptomycin has a volume of distribution of 0.1 Ukg and a plasma elimination half-life of ∼9 hours, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion (∼54%). In patients with reduced renal function, including those receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the dose interval should be 48 hours. No dosage adjustment appears to be necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The use of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been assessed. The most commonly reported adverse events include constipation, nausea, injection-site reactions, headache, and diarrhea. Patients should also be monitored regularly for skeletal muscle toxicity.

This H7N9 virus appeared to infect humans with greater ease than previous avian influenza virus subtypes such as H5N1 and H9N2. While there are other potential explanations for this large number of human infections with an avian influenza virus, we investigated whether a lack of conserved T-cell epitopes between endemic H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and the novel H7N9 virus contributes to this observation. Here we demonstrate that a number of T cell epitopes are conserved between endemic H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and H7N9 virus. Most of these conserved epitopes are from viral internal proteins. The extent of conservation between endemic human seasonal influenza and avian influenza H7N9 was comparable to that with the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1. Thus, the ease of inter-species transmission of H7N9 viruses (compared with avian H5N1 viruses) cannot be attributed to the lack of conservation of such T cell epitopes.

Restricting access to some interventions such as surgery requiring an operating room, advanced imaging, etc. is reasonable due to concern for protecting other patients, visitors and staff. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a special case and the implications for withholding this intervention in situations where it may be desired is discussed, especially with respect to those patients who have suspected, but not proven, infection.

The ability of the number of fulfilled extended donor criteria as currently defined by the German Medical Association (BÄK-Score) to predict early outcome is unclear. PATIENTS: A total of 291 consecutive adult liver transplantations (01.01.2007–31.12.2010) in 257 adult recipients were analyzed. METHODS: Primary study endpoints were 30 day mortality, 3 month mortality, 3 month patient and graft survival and the necessity of acute retransplantation within 30 days. For primary study endpoints a ROC curve analysis was performed to calculate sensitivity, specificity and overall model correctness of the BÄK score as a predictive model. Further methods included Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank tests, Cox regression analysis, logistic regression analysis and χ(2)-tests. RESULTS: The number of extended donor criteria fulfilled had no statistically significant influence on the primary study endpoints (p > 0.05) or on patient survival (p > 0.05). ROC curve analysis revealed areas under the curve ≤ 0.561 for the prediction of primary study endpoints (overall model correctness < 58%, sensitivity < 52%).

It is known that egg production decreases over time, while animal maintenance costs remain stable. It would, however, be desirable to keep hens as long as possible to obtain maximal amounts of antibodies. To identify a suitable length of time that animals can be kept and to optimize the cost:yield ratio, we monitored the number of eggs laid, the total amount of chicken IgY, and the specific antibody titer from individually prepared eggs over a 2-yr period. The plant toxin ricin and the Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins type A and B were used to immunize 4 chickens. The number of eggs laid in 2 yr was approximately 600 per hen (about 80% of the maximum egg number), yielding about 20 to 40 g of total IgY per hen. A stable antibody titer of 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000, as measured by ELISA, was obtained following up to 11 injections of 10 to 20 μg of immobilized native toxin. Laying capacities were found to decrease, on average, from 7 eggs/wk at the point of first immunization to 2 eggs/wk after more than 2 yr. In parallel, the yield of total and specific IgY increased over time, so that the antibody recovery remained high, even after prolonged immunization times. Using purified IgY preparations, classical immunological assays such as ELISA and Western blotting were performed. Furthermore, the IgY showed neutralizing capacity when used to block the functional activity of the toxins both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of the total IgY content over time demonstrated a complex biological oscillation (and the antigen-specific titer), with a shorter time period of around 7 d (circaseptan rhythm). In summary, we successfully immunized chickens with ricin and botulinum neurotoxins and monitored laying capacity, IgY concentration, and specific antibody titer over an extended period of 2 yr.",2009-02-03,"Pauly, D.; Dorner, M.; Zhang, X.; Hlinak, A.; Dorner, B.; Schade, R.",Poult Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a511f79020b10592f2cc3e5596527608b1160358.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107060.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107060/,

As such, real time control and prediction methods present a significant challenge. For diseases which spread through direct human interaction, (e.g., transferred from infected to susceptible individuals) the contagion process can be modeled on a social-contact network where individuals are represented as nodes, and contacts between individuals are represented as links. The model presented in this paper seeks to identify the infection pattern which depicts the current state of an ongoing outbreak. This is accomplished by inferring the most likely paths of infection through a contact network under the assumption of partially available infection data. The problem is formulated as a bi-linear integer program, and heuristic solution methods are developed based on sub-problems which can be solved much more efficiently. The heuristic performance is presented for a range of randomly generated networks and different levels of information.

A major one is that science must simplify/reduce the variables in experimentation and then generalize in terms of a specific factor or effect, whereas patients are complex with variables that we do not yet understand completely. This powerful science is now teaching us about the genetic diversity in both susceptibility and outcome of disease, and the diversity in life experiences and antigen exposures. Clinicians have tried to lump together and treat in a similar way many diverse human diseases. This has not worked well. Pancreatitis and perforated diverticulitis both produce inflammation and sepsis, but they are different processes and may both lead to multiple organ failure.

METHODS: This prospective study compared clinical presentation, outcomes, microbial etiology, and treatment of HCAP, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and immunocompromised patients (ICP) with severe pneumonia admitted to 34 Spanish ICUs. RESULTS: A total of 726 patients with pneumonia (449 CAP, 133 HCAP, and 144 ICP) were recruited during 1 year from April 2011. HCAP patients had more comorbidities and worse clinical status (Barthel score). HCAP and ICP patients needed mechanical ventilation and tracheotomy more frequently than CAP patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen in all three groups (CAP, 34.2 %; HCAP, 19.5 %; ICP, 23.4 %; p = 0.001). The overall incidence of Gram-negative pathogens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was low, but higher in HCAP and ICP patients than CAP. Empirical treatment was in line with CAP guidelines in 73.5 % of patients with CAP, in 45.5 % of those with HCAP, and in 40 % of those with ICP. The incidence of inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was 6.5 % in CAP, 14.4 % in HCAP, and 21.8 % in ICP (p < 0.001). Mortality was highest in ICP (38.6 %) and did not differ between CAP (18.4 %) and HCAP (21.2 %). CONCLUSIONS: HCAP accounts for one-fifth of cases of severe pneumonia in patients admitted to Spanish ICUs. The empirical antibiotic therapy recommended for CAP would be appropriate for 90 % of patients with HCAP in our population, and consequently the decision to include coverage of multidrug-resistant pathogens for HCAP should be cautiously judged in order to prevent the overuse of antimicrobials.

Generally, V. parahaemolyticus recovered from the environment and/or seafood is thought to be non-pathogenic and the relationship between environmental isolates and acute diarrhoeal disease is poorly understood. In this study, we explored the virulence potential of environmental V. parahaemolyticus isolated from water, plankton and assorted seafood samples collected from the Indian coast. RESULTS: Twenty-two V. parahaemolyticus isolates from seafood harboured virulence associated genes encoding the thermostable-direct haemolysin (TDH), TDH-related haemolysin (TRH), and Type 3 secretion systems (T3SS) and 95.5% of the toxigenic isolates had pandemic strain attributes (toxRS/new(+)). Nine serovars, with pandemic strain traits were newly identified and an O4:K36 tdh(−)trh(+)V. parahaemolyticus bearing pandemic marker gene was recognised for the first time. Results obtained by reverse transcription PCR showed trh, T3SS1 and T3SS2β to be functional in the seafood isolates. Moreover, the environmental strains were cytotoxic and could invade Caco-2 cells upon infection as well as induce changes to the tight junction protein, ZO-1 and the actin cytoskeleton. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that environmental isolates of V. parahaemolyticus are potentially invasive and capable of eliciting pathogenic characteristics typical of clinical strains and present a potential health risk. We also demonstrate that virulence of this pathogen is highly complex and hence draws attention for the need to investigate more reliable virulence markers in order to distinguish the environmental and clinical isolates, which will be crucial for the pathogenomics and control of this pathogen.",2020-03-23,"Meparambu Prabhakaran, Divya; Ramamurthy, Thandavarayan; Thomas, Sabu",BMC Microbiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5709b075a81a8aeadbc5c067fe234d83e9d25c31.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092547.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7092547/,

Animal models of viral demyelination and studies showing that JC virus (JCV), the polyomavirus which causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), may be latent in some normal human brains suggest another possibility. A host immune response targeting proteins expressed at low levels from viral DNA latent in the central nervous system (CNS) might underlie a focal demyelinating disease such as MS. A shift from autoimmunity to a latent‐virus model is not a trivial substitution of target antigens.

Five of the most outstanding are: 1) that all risk groups develop AIDS at the same rate following HIV infection; 2) that there are no true seroreversions following HIV infection; 3) that antibody is protective against HIV infection; 4) that the only way to treat AIDS effectively is through retroviral therapies; and 5) that since HIV is so highly correlated with AIDS incidence, it must be the sole necessary and sufficient cause of AIDS. A huge body of research, reviewed in this paper, demonstrates the falsity of these myths. 1) The average number of years between HIV infection and AIDS is greater than 20 years for mild hemophiliacs, 14 years for transfussion severe hemophiliacs, 10 years for old severe hemophiliacs, 10 years for homosexual men, 6 years for transfusion patients of all ages, 2 years for transplant patients, and 6 months for perinatally infected infants. These differences can only be explained in terms of risk-group associated cofactors. 2) Seroreversions are common. Between 10 and 20 percent of HIV-seronegative people in high risk groups have T-cell immunity to HIV, and may have had one or more verified positive HIV antibody tests in the past. 3) Antibody, far from being protective against HIV, appears to be highly diagnostic of loss of immune regulation of HIV, and some evidence of antibody-enhancement of infection exists. 4) Non-retroviral treatments of HIV infection, including safer sex practices, elimination of drug use, high nutrient diets, and limited reexposure to HIV and its cofactors have proven to be effective means of preventing or delaying onset of AIDS. 5) Many immunosuppressive factors, including drug use, multiple concurrent infections, and exposure to alloantigens, are as highly correlated with AIDS risk groups as HIV. These data are more consistent with AIDS being a multifactorial or synergistic disease than a monofactorial one.",1995,"Root-Bernstein, Robert S.",Genetica,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/61a9aaf67b99c6bcf569b576fb8e007d968582a8.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087958/,

The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of pediatric retransplantation from living donor at a single center. METHODS: Between December 1998 to August 2015, retransplantation from a living donor was performed for 14 children (<18 years of age) at Kumamoto University Hospital. The characteristics of the retransplantation recipient and the clinicopathological factors between primary transplantation and retransplantation were analyzed to detect the prognostic factors. RESULTS: In retransplantation, the operative time was longer and the amount of blood loss was greater in comparison to primary transplantation. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates from the date of retransplantation were 85.7, 85.7, and 78.6%, respectively. The rates of re-laparotomy after primary transplantation, bile leakage and postoperative bleeding after retransplantation were higher than after primary transplantation. Among the three patients who died after retransplantation, the operative time, the rate of re-laparotomy after primary transplantation and the incidence of gastrointestinal complications were higher in comparison to the surviving patients. CONCLUSION: Pediatric retransplantation from a living donor is an acceptable procedure that could save the lives of recipients with failing allografts when organs from deceased donors are scarce.

We sought to determine the probability of weaning and overall survival of cancer patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation in a specialized weaning unit. METHODS: A single-institution retrospective review of patients requiring mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting from 2008 to 2012 and from January 1 to December 31, 2018, was performed. Demographic and clinical data were recorded, including cancer specifics, comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes. Overall survival was determined using the Kaplan-Meier approach. Time to weaning was analyzed using the cumulative incidence function, with death considered a competing risk. Prognostic factors were evaluated for use in prospective evaluations of weaning protocols. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2012, 122 patients required mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting with weaning as a goal of care. The cumulative incidence of weaning after discharge from the intensive care unit was 42% at 21 days, 49% at 30 days, 58% at 60 days, 61% at 90 days, and 61% at 120 days. The median survival was 0.16 years (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.33) for those not weaned and 1.05 years (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.34) for those weaned. Overall survival at 1 year and 2 years was 52 and 32% among those weaned and 16 and 9% among those not weaned. During 2018, 36 patients at our institution required mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting, with weaning as a goal of care. Overall, with a median follow-up of 140 days (range, 0–425 days; average, 141 days), 25% of patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation (9 of 36) are alive. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients can be weaned from long-term mechanical ventilation, even after prolonged periods of support.

Angiotensin II, whose target is the AT1R, is a potent vasoconstrictor. Accordingly, an imbalance leading to enhanced activity of the angiotensin II-AT1R axis is postulated to contribute to both circulatory disturbances and lung injury. In this context, a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism, AT1R A1166C, which leads to enhanced responsiveness of the AT1R, has been postulated as a candidate susceptibility factor for ischemic stroke. The aim of our study was to investigate its occurrence in ischemic stroke and to analyze its possible synergistic associations with clinical risk factors. Genetic and clinical data on 308 consecutive patients with acutely developing ischemic stroke were analyzed. A total of 272 stroke and neuroimaging alteration-free subjects served as a control group. Univariate and logistic regression statistical approaches were used. Alone, the AT1R 1166C allele did not pose a risk of stroke. In hypertensive smokers, however, it was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (OR 22.3, 95% CI 5.8–110.2, p<0.001). Further subgroup analysis revealed the same association for both small-vessel (OR 24.3, 95% CI 6.1–121.1, p<0.001) and large-vessel (OR 21.3, 95% CI 4.6–81.1, p<0.001) infarction.

Gr levels correlated with the total leukocyte counts and IL-8 levels in the airways at several time points. However, no correlation between Gr levels and release of caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 was found.

Design and setting: Observational study in a tertiary referral center, Intensive Care Unit, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital at Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Subjects and methods: Seventeen adult patients with ARDS were treated with venovenous or venoarterial ECMO after failure of conventional therapy. The Murray score of pulmonary injury averaged 3.5 (3.0–4.0) and the mean PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was 46 (31–65). A standard ECMO circuit with nonheparinized surfaces was used. The patients were minimally sedated and received pressure-supported ventilation. High inspiratory pressures were avoided and arterial saturation as low as 70% was accepted on venovenous bypass. Results: In one patient a stable bypass could not be established. Among the remaining 16 patients 13 survived (total survival rate 76%) after 3–52 days (mean 15) on bypass. Major surgical procedures were performed in several patients. The cause of death in the three nonsurvivors was intracranial complications leading to total cerebral infarction. Conclusion: A high survival rate can be obtained in adult patients with severe ARDS using ECMO and pressure-supported ventilation with minimal sedation. Surgical complications are amenable to surgical treatment during ECMO. Bleeding problems can generally be controlled but require immediate and aggressive approach.

Significant efforts have been made to develop novel vaccines and therapeutics; however, the interaction of NDV with the host is not yet fully understood. Interferons (IFNs), an integral component of innate immune signaling, act as the first line of defense against invading viruses. Compared with the mammalian repertoire of IFNs, limited information is available on the antiviral potential of IFNs in chickens. Here, we expressed chicken IFN-γ (chIFN-γ) using a baculovirus expression vector system, characterized its antiviral potential against NDV, and determined its antiviral potential. Priming of chicken embryo fibroblasts with chIFN-γ elicited an antiviral environment in primary cells, which was mainly due to interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). A genome-wide transcriptomics approach was used to elucidate the possible signaling pathways associated with IFN-γ-induced immune responses. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed significant induction of ISG-associated pathways, activated temporal expression of ISGs, antiviral mediators, and transcriptional regulators in a cascade of antiviral responses. Collectively, we found that IFN-γ significantly elicited an antiviral response against NDV infection.

Some such studies have been conducted among Western travelers; however, to our knowledge, there have been no reports on Japanese travelers. METHODS: Malaria cases that were diagnosed between April 1999 and December 2005 and were reported to the national infectious disease surveillance body were used as the numerators after grouped into countries of disease acquisition. The denominators, the numbers of Japanese travelers visiting individual countries were derived from the recipient countries and obtained through a Japanese organization. RESULTS: In addition to the well-documented high risks in sub-Saharan countries, our study showed that travelers to Papua New Guinea were exposed to a significantly high risk of malaria. In Asia, Myanmar had the highest risk. Generally, malaria incidence rates among Japanese travelers were lower than those previously reported on Western travelers. However, the rates were rather comparable to the data obtained recently. CONCLUSIONS: These malaria incidence data in travelers should be taken into consideration for pre-travel risk assessment.

Two substrains of Sprague-Dawley rats (A and B) differing in average daily weight gain were used. Female rats of substrain A gained 2 g per day and males gained 7 g. Female rats of substrain B gained 5 g per day and males gained 8 g. Animals were implanted with a stainless steel guide cannula, allowing ICV injections into the lateral ventricle. ICV injections of 1, 5, or 10 μg of oxytocin or isotonic saline in a volume of 5 μl were given. In females, ICV treatment with either saline or 5 μg of oxytocin caused a transient loss of weight within 24 h of treatment. However, in the more slowly growing females of substrain A depression in body weight was observed after a single treatment with saline, whereas the body weight of oxytocin-treated females showed less marked depression and rapidly returned to the pretreatment weight. After a 3-day treatment period an even greater difference in daily weight gain was seen between oxytocin-treated and saline-treated female rats of substrain A. In contrast, no difference in daily weight gain or food intake was observed between oxytocin- and saline-treated male rats of substrain A, nor in females or males of the more rapidly growing substrain B. Intraperitoneal injections of 5 μg of oxytocin did not influence food intake or daily weight gain in female rats of substrain A.

The impact of Hurricane Sandy on New York City area hospitals provided a unique opportunity to learn from the experience of ICU providers about their preparedness, perspective, roles, and activities. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians who played direct roles during the Hurricane Sandy ICU evacuations. RESULTS: Sixty-eight health care professionals from 4 evacuating hospitals completed surveys (35% ICU nurses, 21% respiratory therapists, 25% physicians-in-training, and 13% attending physicians). Only 21% had participated in an ICU evacuation drill in the past 2 years and 28% had prior training or real-life experience. Processes were inconsistent for patient prioritization, tracking, transport medications, and transport care. Respondents identified communication (43%) as the key barrier to effective evacuation. The equipment considered most helpful included flashlights (24%), transport sleds (21%), and oxygen tanks and respiratory therapy supplies (19%). An evacuation wish list included walkie-talkies/phones (26%), lighting/electricity (18%), flashlights (10%), and portable ventilators and suction (16%). CONCLUSIONS: ICU providers who evacuated critically ill patients during Hurricane Sandy had little prior knowledge of evacuation processes or vertical evacuation experience. The weakest links in the patient evacuation process were communication and the availability of practical tools. Incorporating ICU providers into hospital evacuation planning and training, developing standard evacuation communication processes and tools, and collecting a uniform dataset among all evacuating hospitals could better inform critical care evacuation in the future.

Infants, pregnant women and the elderly are at increased risk of invasive group A streptococcal infection. The group A streptococcus has an array of virulence factors that underpin its invasive capacity and, in approximately 10% of cases, super-antigen toxins produced by the bacteria stimulate a large proportion of T cells, leading to streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Given the rapid clinical progression, effective management of invasive group A streptococcal infections hinges on early recognition of the disease and prompt initiation of supportive care (often intensive care) together with antibacterial therapy. In cases of toxic shock syndrome, it is often difficult to distinguish between streptococcal and staphylococcal infection before cultures become available and so antibacterial choice must include coverage of both of these organisms. In addition, clindamycin is an important adjunctive antibacterial because of its anti-toxin effects and excellent tissue penetration. Early institution of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy should be considered in cases of toxic shock syndrome and severe invasive infection, including necrotizing fasciitis.

J. D. White attributed to a constraint in spiders, namely their proximal chiasma localization acting to upset meiotic segregation in males with fusions. Of the 75 taxa of Habronattus and outgroups studied, 47 have X(1)X(2)0 sex chromosomes in males, 10 have X(1)X(2)Y, 15 have X(1)X(2)X(3)Y, 2 have X0, and one has both X(1)X(2)0 and X(1)X(2)X(3)Y. Chromosome numbers and behavior suggest neo‐Ys formed by an autosome‐X fusion to make X(1)X(2)Y, with a second fusion to an autosome to make X(1)X(2)X(3)Y. Phylogeny shows at least 8–15 gains (or possibly some losses) of neo‐Y (i.e., X‐autosome fusions), a remarkable number for such a small clade. In contrast to the many X‐autosome fusions, at most one autosome–autosome fusion is indicated. Origins of neo‐Y are correlated significantly with distal localization of chiasmata, supporting White's hypothesis that evolution of neo‐Y systems is facilitated by looser pairing (distal chiasmata) at meiosis. However, an alternative (or contributing) explanation for the correlation is that X‐autosome fusions were selected to permit isolation of male‐favored alleles to the neo‐Y chromosome, aided by distal chiasmata limiting recombination.

BVDV has been grouped into two genotypes, genotype 1 and genotype 2. In this study, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values, effective number of codon (ENC) values and nucleotide content were investigated, and a comparative analysis of codon usage patterns for open reading frames (ORFs) of 22 BVDV genomes, including 14 of genotype 1 and 8 of genotype 2, was carried out. A high A+U content and low codon bias were found in BVDV genomes. Depending on the RSCU data, it was found that there was a significant variation in bias of codon usage between the two genotypes, and a geographic factor exists only in genotype-1 of BVDV. The RSCU data have a negative correlation with general average hydrophobicity (GRAVY), aromaticity and nucleotide content. Furthermore, the overall abundance of C and U has no effect on the synonymous codon usage patterns. In contrast, the A and G content showed a significant correlation with the nucleotide content at the third position. In addition, the codon usage patterns of BVDV are similar to those of 22 conserved genes of Bos taurus. Taken together, the genetic characteristics of BVDV possibly result from interactions between natural seclection and mutation pressure.

Overactivity of RAAS promotes both systemic and regional glomerular capillary hypertension, which could induce hemodynamic injury to the glomerulus, leading to kidney damage and renal fibrosis via profibrotic and proinflammatory pathway. Therefore, the use of RAAS inhibitors (i.e., ACEIs, ARBs, and MRAs) as the optional therapy has been demonstrated to prevent proteinuria, and kidney fibrosis and slow the decline of renal function effectively in the process of kidney disease during the last few decades. Recently, several new components of the RAAS have been discovered, including ACE2 and the corresponding ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis, which are also present in the kidney. Besides the classic RAAS inhibitors target the angiotensin-AT1-aldosterone axis, with the expanding knowledge about RAAS, a number of potential therapeutic targets in this system is emerging. Newer agents that are more specific are being developed.

Various experimental approaches, the complex signaling pathways of mammalian cells, and the use of different species orthologues render it difficult to compare and interpret the published results. Thus, the four human histamine receptor subtypes were analyzed side-by-side in the Sf9 insect cell expression system, using radioligand binding assays as well as functional readouts proximal to the receptor activation event (steady-state GTPase assays and [(35)S]GTPγS assays). The human H(1)R was co-expressed with the regulators of G protein signaling RGS4 or GAIP, which unmasked a productive interaction between hH(1)R and insect cell Gα(q). By contrast, functional expression of the hH(2)R required the generation of an hH(2)R-Gsα fusion protein to ensure close proximity of G protein and receptor. Fusion of hH(2)R to the long (Gsα(L)) or short (Gsα(S)) splice variant of Gα(s) resulted in comparable constitutive hH(2)R activity, although both G protein variants show different GDP affinities. Medicinal chemistry studies revealed profound species differences between hH(1)R/hH(2)R and their guinea pig orthologues gpH(1)R/gpH(2)R. The causes for these differences were analyzed by molecular modeling in combination with mutational studies. Co-expression of the hH(3)R with Gα(i1), Gα(i2), Gα(i3), and Gα(i/o) in Sf9 cells revealed high constitutive activity and comparable interaction efficiency with all G protein isoforms. A comparison of various cations (Li(+), Na(+), K(+)) and anions (Cl(−), Br(−), I(−)) revealed that anions with large radii most efficiently stabilize the inactive hH(3)R state. Potential sodium binding sites in the hH(3)R protein were analyzed by expressing specific hH(3)R mutants in Sf9 cells. In contrast to the hH(3)R, the hH(4)R preferentially couples to co-expressed Gα(i2) in Sf9 cells. Its high constitutive activity is resistant to NaCl or GTPγS. The hH(4)R shows structural instability and adopts a G protein-independent high-affinity state. A detailed characterization of affinity and activity of a series of hH(4)R antagonists/inverse agonists allowed first conclusions about structure/activity relationships for inverse agonists at hH(4)R. In summary, the Sf9 cell system permitted a successful side-by-side comparison of all four human histamine receptor subtypes. This chapter summarizes the results of pharmacological as well as medicinal chemistry/molecular modeling approaches and demonstrates that these data are not only important for a deeper understanding of H(x)R pharmacology, but also have significant implications for the molecular pharmacology of GPCRs in general.",2017-02-24,"Schneider, Erich H.; Seifert, Roland",Histamine and Histamine Receptors in Health and Disease,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/eef81233541c4504a9dc542873a5a8dca4a313e6.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120522.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120522/,

We used lacZ left-frameshift reporter constructs carrying the sequence U UUC xyz, where xyz was each of three triplets coding for three different amino acids; we slowed the ribosomes at each of these by limiting for the amino acid or for the aminoacyl-tRNA. In all cases, limitation stimulated leftward frameshifting. In all cases, the stimulation was greater in relA mutant cells than in their wild-type relA (+) counterparts. In the latter genotype, the increased frameshifting was constant from the start of the limitation regime. This was also true of the relA mutant strain during limitation for lysine-tRNA or for leucine; however, during limitation for isoleucine-tRNA (or for isoleucine) the mutant showed a gradual, progressive increase in frameshifting, suggesting an indirect effect. We suggest that gradual accumulation of undermodified tRNAs, which is characteristic of the relA response, is involved. However, the specific modification involved is unknown.

The methodology mapped into the software package TensorCalculator was successfully applied to the empty cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) shell to explore the evolution of mechanical stress in this mechanically-tested specific example of a soft virus capsid. We found an inhomogeneous stress distribution in various portions of the CCMV structure and stress transfer from one portion of the virus structure to another, which also points to the importance of entropic effects, often ignored in finite element analysis and elastic network modeling. We formulate a criterion for elastic deformation using the first principal stress components.

Both quantitative and qualitative techniques, whether signal or target amplification based systems, are currently used routinely in most if not all virology laboratories. Technological improvements, from automated sample isolation to real time amplification technology, have given the ability to develop and introduce systems for most viruses of clinical interest, and to obtain clinical relevant information needed for optimal antiviral treatment options. Both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) can currently be used together with real time detection to generate results in a short turn-around time and to determine whether variants relevant for antiviral resistance are present. These new technologies enable the introduction of an individual patient disease management concept. Within our clinical setting, we have introduced this e.g. for quantitative detection of Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) in T-dell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. This enabled us to develop models for pre-emptive anti B-cell immunotherapy for EBV reactivation, thereby effectively reducing not the incidence of EBV-lymphoproliferative disease but the virus related mortality. Furthermore, additional clinically relevant viruses can now easily be detected simultaneously. It also becomes more feasible to introduce molecular testing for those viruses that can easily be detected using classical virological methods, like culture techniques or antigen detection. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of the additional positive samples detected. It should however be made clear that a complete exchange of technologies is unlikely to occur, and that some complementary technologies should stay operational enabling the discovery of new viruses. The implementation of these molecular diagnostic technologies furthermore warrants the use and introduction of standardized materials as well as participation in international quality control programs. Finally, the use of an internal control throughout the whole procedure not only ensures the accuracy of the results generated, but also is necessary to enable precise quantification of these results and to determine detection thresholds more accurately. Since so many targets do have clinical implications, laboratories might prefer to use universal internal controls before the in-house developed assays should be introduced in clinical virology.",2002-12-03,"Niesters, Hubert G.M",J Clin Virol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/151b80cfa218d8a252c1720d3e2f2e7b1effd96c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128152.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128152/,

We wished to determine the potential for pulmonary overexpression of the extracellular isoform of superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) to reduce the severity of endotoxin-induced lung injury. METHODS: Animals were randomly allocated to undergo intratracheal instillation of (1) surfactant alone (vehicle); (2) adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors containing a null transgene (AAV-null); and (3) adeno-associated virus vectors containing the EC-SOD transgene (AAV-EC-SOD) and endotoxin was subsequently administered intratracheally. Two additional groups were randomized to receive (1) vehicle or (2) AAV-EC-SOD, and to undergo sham (vehicle) injury. The severity of the lung injury was assessed in all animals 24 h later. RESULTS: Endotoxin produced a severe lung injury compared to sham injury. The AAV vector encoding EC-SOD increased lung EC-SOD concentrations, and enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the lung. EC-SOD overexpression decreased the severity of endotoxin-induced ALI, reducing the decrement in systemic oxygenation and lung compliance, decreasing lung permeability and decreasing histologic injury. EC-SOD attenuated pulmonary inflammation, decreased bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil counts, and reduced interleukin-6 and CINC-1 concentrations. The AAV vector itself did not contribute to inflammation or to lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary overexpression of EC-SOD protects the lung against endotoxin-induced ALI.

Therapeutic actions are limited to vaccines and a few anti-viral drugs. Polygala (P.) japonica herba is rich in Polygalasaponin F (PSF, C(53)H(86)O(23)), used for acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, amygdalitis, and respiratory tract infections treatment in China. Hypercytokinemia is often correlated with severe pneumonia caused by several influenza viruses. PSF was reported to have anti-inflammatory effects and its mechanism is associated with the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway. The action of PSF to alleviate pulmonary inflammation caused by influenza A virus (IAV) infection requires careful assessment. In the present study, we evaluated the effect and mechanism of PSF on mice with pneumonia caused by influenza H1N1 (A/FM/1/47). METHODS: Mice were infected intranasally with fifteen 50% mouse lethal challenge doses (MLD(50)) of influenza virus. BALB/c mice were treated with PSF or oseltamivir (oral administration) for 2 h post-infection and received concomitant treatment for 5 days after infection. On day 6 post-infection, 10 mice per group were killed to collect related samples, measure body weight and lung wet weight, and detect the viral load, cytokine, prostaglandins, pathological changes, and cell pathway protein expression in the lungs. In addition, the survival experiments were carried out to investigate the survival of mice. The expression profile of cell pathway proteins was detected and analyzed using a broad pathway antibody array and confirmed the findings from the array by western blotting. RESULTS: Polygalasaponin F and oseltamivir can protect against influenza viral infection in mice. PSF and oseltamivir significantly relieved the signs and symptoms, reduced body weight loss, and improved the survival rate of H1N1-infected mice. Moreover, PSF efficiently decreased the level of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-4, interferon (IFN)-γ, thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)), and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in lung tissues of mice infected with influenza virus (p < 0.05–0.01). Oseltamivir had a similar effect to lung cytokine of PSF, but did not decrease the levels of TXA(2) and PGE(2). There was a twofold or greater increase in four cell pathway protein, namely NF-κB p65 (2.68-fold), I-kappa-B-alpha (IκBα) (2.56-fold), and MAPK/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) (7.15-fold) assessed in the array induced by influenza virus. Western blotting showed that the expression of these proteins was significantly decreased in lung after influenza virus challenge in PSF and oseltamivir-treated mice (p < 0.05–0.01). CONCLUSION: Polygalasaponin F appears to be able to augment protection against IAV infection in mice via attenuation of pulmonary inflammatory responses. Its effect on IAV-induced pulmonary inflammation was associated with suppression of Raf/MEK/ERK and NF-κB expressions.",2019-08-24,"Ye, Yi; Wang, Huixian; Liu, Jinyuan; Zhao, Fang; Xu, Peiping",Inflammopharmacology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e55b25fed065fba0ac677e1e74577cb14d207c9e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102181.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102181/,

Chest X-ray features of 300 consecutive patients who had undergone 333 liver transplants over an 11-year period were analysed: the type of pulmonary complication, the infecting pathogens and the mean time of their occurrence are described. The main risk factors for lung infections were quantified through univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Non-infectious pulmonary abnormalities (atelectasis and/or pleural effusion: 86.7 %) and pulmonary oedema (44.7 %) appeared during the first postoperative week. Infectious pneumonia was observed in 13.7 %, with a mortality of 36.6 %. Bacterial and viral pneumonia made up the bulk of infections (63.4 and 29.3 %, respectively) followed by fungal infiltrates (24.4 %). A fairly good correlation between radiological chest X-ray pattern, time of onset and the cultured microorganisms has been observed in all cases. In multivariate analysis, persistent non-infectious abnormalities and pulmonary oedema were identified as the major independent predictors of posttransplant pneumonia, followed by prolonged assisted mechanical ventilation and traditional caval anastomosis. A “pneumonia-risk score” was calculated: low-risk score ( < 2.25) predicts 2.7 % of probability of the onset of infections compared with 28.7 % of high-risk ( > 3.30) population. The “pneumonia-risk score” identifies a specific group of patients in whom closer radiographic monitoring is recommended. In addition, a highly significant correlation (p < 0.001) was observed between pneumonia-risk score and the expected survival, thus confirming pulmonary infections as a major cause of death in OLT recipients.",2000,"Golfieri, R.; Giampalma, E.; Morselli Labate, A.

Within 48 h of the diagnosis of sepsis they were given primed constant i.v. infusions of L-[1-(13)C]phenylalanine and L-[3,3,(2)H(2)]tyrosine for 4 h. Routine nutritional support continued during this period by parentcral administration of dextrose, lipid emulsion, and an amino acid mixture low in tyrosine. Phenylalanine and tyrosine fluxes and rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation did not differ significantly between the two age groups, and so the data were combined for evaluation. For the entire group, values (μmol-kg(−1)-h(−1); mean ± SD) for phenylalanine and tyrosine fluxes and rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation were 132 ± 24, 66 ± 16, and 29 ± 12, respectively. Plasma phenylalanine to tyrosine concentration ratio was 1.67 ± 0.6. From a comparison of the rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation with measured phenylalanine intakes, it was concluded that their routine, clinical nutritional support was inadequate to achieve body phenylalanine balance. In comparison with published data, the relative rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation appears to be high. We speculate that tyrosine is a conditionally indispensable amino acid under these conditions; it would be desirable to establish the intake levels and ratio of phenylalanine to tyrosine that effectively support aromatic amino acid balance in these critically ill patients.",1994,"Castillo, Leticia; Yu, Y Ming; Marchini, J Sergio; Chapman, Thomas E; Sanchez, Melchor; Young, Vernon R; Burke, John F",Pediatr Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/01721c2ebdf8f55b676efc82534684dcc414211e.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102387/,

METHODS: In a prospective, cross-sectional, multicentre study, data on 540 patients with confirmed 2009 H1N1 infection from seven Austrian hospitals were collected using a standardised online case-history form. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 19.3 years (range 26 days–90.8 years); point-of-care testing yielded false-negative results in 60.2% of the 176 cases tested. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue and headache. Overall, 343 patients (63.5%) were hospitalised, 49 (9.1%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and 14 (4.1%) died. Case fatality rates were highest (9.1%) in those aged 65 years or older. Factors significantly associated with a higher risk for ICU admission included age, neurological disease, adipositas, and both interstitial pathology and lobular pathology on chest X-ray. No association with pregnancy, malignancy or immunosuppressive therapy was detected. Antiviral treatment significantly reduced the duration of fever by 0.66 days and lowered the risk of ICU admission, but had no significant benefit on survival. CONCLUSIONS: During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, elderly or obese patients and those with neurological disease had an increased risk for severe H1N1 infection in Austria.

According to the World Health Organization, it is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the world, and further increases in the prevalence and mortality of the disease is predicted for the coming decades.

The burden of COPD in Asia is currently greater than that in developed Western countries, both in terms of the total number of deaths and the burden of disease, as measured in years of life lost and years spent living with disability. The types of health-care policies and the practice of medicine vary considerably among the regions of Asia and have an impact on the burden of disease. Treatment aims in Asian countries are based on evidence-based management guidelines. Barriers to the implementation of disease management guidelines are related to issues of resource conflict and lack of organizational support rather than cultural differences in medical practice. To reduce this burden of COPD in Asian countries, there is a need for a multifaceted approach in improving awareness of prevalence and disease burden, in facilitating accurate diagnosis of COPD among chronic respiratory diseases, in championing health policies that reduce the burden of the main risk factors for COPD and in the wider use of evidence-based management for COPD.",2015-12-28,"Tan, Wan C.; Ng, Tze P.",Chest,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/17c85ef1ea21788aaee989005ce0992a14e28af6.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094310.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094310/,

Setting: Dermatology intensive care unit in Mondor Hospital, France. Patients: 41 consecutive patients. Interventions: On admission, then daily, respiratory evaluation was based on clinical examination, chest X-ray, and arterial blood gas analysis. When clinical symptoms, X-ray abnormalities, or hypoxemia [partial pressure of oxygen (PO(2))<80 mm Hg] were present, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed. Results: 10 patients presented early manifestations: dyspnea (n=10), bronchial hypersecretion (n=7), marked hypoxemia (n=10) (PO(2)=59 ± 8 mmHg). Chest X-ray was normal (n = 8) or showed interstitial infiltrates (n=2). In these 10 patients, fiberoptic bronchoscopy demonstrated sloughing of bronchial epithelium in proximal airways. Delayed pulmonary complications occurred in 6 of these 10 patients from day 7 to day 15: pulmonary edema (n=2), atelectasis (n=1), bacterial pneumonitis (n=4). Mechanical ventilation was required in 9 patients. A fatal outcome occurred in 7 patients. Seven patients did not develop early pulmonary manifestations (PO(2) on admission 87 ± 6 mm Hg) but only delayed pulmonary symptoms related to atelectasis (n=1), pulmonary edema (n=4), and bacterial pneumonitis (n=3); bronchial epithelial detachment was not observed. None of them required mechanical ventilation and all recovered with appropriate therapy. Conclusions: “Specific” involvement of bronchial epithelium was noted in 27 % of cases and must be suspected when dyspnea, bronchial hypersecretion, normal chest X-ray, and marked hypoxemia are present during the early stages of toxic epidermal necrosis. Bronchial injury seems to indicate a poor prognosis, as mechanical ventilation was required for most of these patients and was associated with a high mortality.",1997,"Lebargy, F.; Wolkenstein, P.; Gisselbrecht, M.; Lange, F.; Fleury-Feith, J.; Delclaux, C.; Roupie, E.; Revuz, J.; Roujeau, J.

Cases were compared with controls, collectively and in analyses restricted to each genetic group; these comparisons were repeated considering the three categories of patients with demyelination and two control populations separately All DR2+, DR3+ and DR2/3 individuals were compared in a single analysis to assess the effect of HLA type itself on the results Patients with demyelinating disease had rubella and measles at a later age and reported mumps infection more frequently than controls. Age of typhoid vaccination and duration of exposure to domestic dogs was higher in all cases than controls. Age of measles and mumps, but not rubella, was higher in DR2 + cases than controls, but differences were not observed in the other genetic groups Higher rubella antibody titres were present in all cases than controls and in analyses confined to DR2+ individuals in whom higher Epstein Barr virus antibody titres were also present Measles haemagglutination inhibition and parainfluenza I antibody titres were increased and influenza A antibodies detected less frequently in all patients with optic neuntis and those with DR2 compared with appropnate controls; influenza B antibody titres were lower in all DR2+ cases than controls.

Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy, the outcomes of HSCT for XIAP deficiency remain unsatisfactory compared with those for SLAM-associated protein deficiency and familial HLH. AIM: To investigate the outcomes and adverse events of HSCT for patients with XIAP deficiency, a national survey was conducted. METHODS: A spreadsheet questionnaire was sent to physicians who had provided HSCT treatment for patients with XIAP deficiency in Japan. RESULTS: Up to the end of September 2016, 10 patients with XIAP deficiency had undergone HSCT in Japan, 9 of whom (90%) had survived. All surviving patients had received a fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. Although 5 patients developed post-HSCT HLH, 4 of them survived after etoposide administration. In addition, the IBD associated with XIAP deficiency improved remarkably after HSCT in all affected cases. CONCLUSION: The RIC regimen and HLH control might be important factors for successful HSCT outcomes, with improved IBD, in patients with XIAP deficiency.

Cells were mobilized with G-CSF from HLA-matched related donors and cryopreserved. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate; G-CSF was administered post-transplant.

CD4/CD8(+) ratio was 1.9 on day 28 after alloBSCT, then gradually declined to 0.8 at 1 year due to more rapid CD8(+) cell recovery. Mean phytohemagglutinin-induced T cell responses were lower than normal on day +28 (P < 0.05), then tended to recover towards normal values. Natural-killer cytotoxicity remained low from day +28 to 1 year post-alloBSCT, but considerable lymphokine-activated killer cytotoxicity was induced from cells already obtained on day +28. Faster lymphocyte recovery correlated with better survival in alloBSCT patients (median follow-up 287 days, P = 0.002), ALC recovery was not affected by acute GVHD, CMV infections or doses of infused cells. ALC recovery did not correlate with survival in either historical alloBMT group.

This qualitative study employs a social-ecological framework to examine how macro (historical, legislative, political, socio-economic factors), meso (sources of information, social support, social mobilization) and micro level factors (individual actions, behavioral changes) interacted to influence the response and behavior of women with respect to Zika in different contexts. METHODS: A qualitative study was carried out. Women were recruited through the snowball sampling technique from various locations in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the United States. They were of different nationalities and ethnicities. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The data transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Women in this study deemed the information provided as insufficient, which led them to actively reach out and access a variety of media sources. Social networks played a vital role in sharing information but also resulted in the spread of hoaxes or rumors. Participants in our research perceived socio-economic inequities but focused on how to remedy their microenvironments. They did not engage in major social activities. Lack of trust in governments placed women in vulnerable situations by preventing them to follow the guidance of health authorities. These impacts were also a result of the response tactics of health and government administrations in their failed attempts to ensure the well-being of their countries’ populations.

This notion holds true irrespective of the genome type. At first glance the argument seems to be weak in the case of enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses with single-stranded (ss) segmented or non-segmented genomes of positive (+) or negative polarity. Here, there are several families infecting V or P only; no systematic relation to arthropods is found. c) In the non-enveloped plant viruses with ss RNA genomes there is a strong tendency for segmentation and individual packaging of the genome pieces. This is in contrast to ss+ RNA animal viruses and can only be explained by massive transmission by seed or insects or both, because individual packaging necessitates a multihit infection. Comparisons demonstrate relationships in the nonstructural proteins of double-stranded and ss+ RNA viruses irrespective of host range, segmentation, and envelope. Similar conclusions apply for the negative-stranded RNA viruses. Thus, viral supergroups can be created that infect V or P and exploit arthropods for infection or transmission or both.

Viral transduction of structural and regulatory genes provides a means for information to leave the body of an organism other than through the germ cells. Natural selection acts upon the cell–virus nucleic acid coupling and the rate and direction of the evolution of any species depends upon the number of associated viruses and the extent to and speed with which they allow information to be cycled through the total gene pool of that population. There are three mechanisms by which gene material can be transferred from cell to cell: (1) transformation, (2) transduction, and (3) sexual conjugation. Transformation is the most random and inefficient process; it requires the laws of diffusion and the existing chemistry of the cell membrane, modified in contemporary cells by the development of transport systems, which facilitate membrane penetration. Transduction requires the development of genes for capsomere proteins to encapsidate nucleic acid and a sophistication of the process of membrane evagination to package nucleic acid into free particles, These are relatively modest genetic adaptations. However, true sexual union as it occurs in modern eukaryotes, requires such a high degree of cytological organization that it is inconceivable that it could have operated efficiently during the first billion or so years of cell evolution.",2008-02-28,"Reanney, D.C.",Int Rev Cytol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e25748c65fb3bd1bbdb71e1a074d2a6173e5081a.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133209/,

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The case study research is based on an analysis of official documentation and interviews with policy elites at multiple levels of UK governance. FINDINGS: Results of this study show that policy actors regard risk communication, the dynamics of international public policy and UK territorial governance as the main governance challenges in the management of influenza at a macro-level. The paper also serves to identify that although contingencies management for epidemiological issues require technical and scientific considerations to feature in governance arrangements, equally there are key “wicked problems” in the context public policy that pervade the health security sector. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study indicates the need to build in resources at a national level to plan for policy coordination challenges in areas that might at first be seen as devoid of political machinations (such as technical areas of public policy that might be underpinned by epidemiological processes). The identification of the major governance challenges that emerge from the pandemic influenza case study is a springboard for a research agenda in relation to the analysis of the parallels and paradoxes of governance challenges for health security across EU member states.

In establishing infection these icosahedral viruses undergo endosomal membrane fusion catalysed by envelope glycoprotein rearrangement of the putative receptor-binding domain III (DIII) and exposure of the hydrophobic fusion loop(2,3,4). Humoral immunity has an essential protective function early in the course of West Nile virus infection(5,6). Here, we investigate the mechanism of neutralization by the E16 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds DIII. Structurally, the E16 antibody Fab fragment engages 16 residues positioned on four loops of DIII, a consensus neutralizing epitope sequence conserved in West Nile virus and distinct in other flaviviruses. The E16 epitope protrudes from the surface of mature virions in three distinct environments(7), and docking studies predict Fab binding will leave five-fold clustered epitopes exposed. We also show that E16 inhibits infection primarily at a step after viral attachment, potentially by blocking envelope glycoprotein conformational changes. Collectively, our results suggest that a vaccine strategy targeting the dominant DIII epitope may elicit safe and effective immune responses against flaviviral diseases.

Limiting the disruption of critical infrastructures during a pandemic is important for the survival and health of society (i.e., electricity, water, and food) as most medical and public health responses to a pandemic depend on these infrastructures. The studies that have looked at this issue have highlighted alarming gaps in preparedness. This study used a system dynamics model to demonstrate the likely effects of a pandemic on the USA’s food system. The model reveals that a severe pandemic with greater than a 25 % reduction in labor availability can create significant and widespread food shortages. The Ebola epidemic that began in 2014 has caused severe food shortages in West Africa, which are similar to the effects that this model predicts in the USA. The likely effects of the reduction in the amount of available food are difficult to specifically predict; however, it is likely to have severe negative consequences on society. The resilience of the food system must be improved against this hazard and others.

However, controversial results were obtained regarding the involvement of IL-8 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. This study examines the role of IL-8 in the recruitment and activation of PMNs in the lung of pneumonia patients. The interesting aspect of this study is that it is a site- specific analysis of the infected and uninfected lungs of the same patient. The level of IL-8 mRNA, protein and myeloperoxidase present in the cells of the bronchioalveolar lavages (BALs) taken from the areas of known pneumonic consolidations on chest X-ray (infected lung) are compared with the BALs obtained from areas of no obvious infiltrate (non-infected lung). The results obtained from the infected and non-infected lungs of pneumonic patients were further compared with that of a control group of non-smoking patients. The level of IL-8 mRNA and protein were determined by RT-PCR and ELISA respectively. There was a significant increase in the level of IL-8 mRNA in the infected lung as compared to its level in the non-infected lung (p < 0.001). In correlation with the increase in mRNA, IL-8 protein concentrations in BAL fluids from the infected lung were 6 fold higher than those taken from the non-infected lung (p < 0.0001). This pattern was also consistent with MPO activity in the BALs (4.5 fold more MPO activity in the infected lung as compared to that of the non-infected lung), indicating that IL-8 is directly implicated in neutrophil accumulation that follows acute respiratory infection. The results of the present study, therefore, indicate the involvement of IL-8 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.",2001,"Abul, H.; Abul, A.; Khan, I.; Matthew, T.C.; Ayed, A.; Al-Athary, E.",Mol Cell Biochem,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/adf8acf37845329368a5f9e44e03fb4fe3ce1b22.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102223/,

Here, we present an example of viral targeting for immune evasion through spatial isolation of TBK1/IKKε from mitochondrial antiviral platform, which was employed by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a deadly bunyavirus emerging recently. We showed that SFTSV nonstructural protein NSs functions as the interferon (IFN) antagonist, mainly via suppressing TBK1/IKKε–IRF3 signaling. NSs mediates the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs), and the blockage of IB formation impairs IFN-inhibiting activity of NSs. We next demonstrate that IBs are utilized to compartmentalize TBK1/IKKε. The compartmentalization results in spatial isolation of the kinases from mitochondria, and deprived TBK1/IKKε may participate in antiviral complex assembly, leading to the blockage of IFN induction. This study proposes a new role of viral IBs as virus-built ‘jail’ for imprisoning cellular factors and presents a novel and likely common mechanism of viral immune evasion through spatial isolation of critical signaling molecules from the mitochondrial antiviral platform.",2014-08-01,"Ning, Yun-Jia; Wang, Manli; Deng, Maping; Shen, Shu; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wu-Chun; Deng, Fei; Wang, Yan-Yi; Hu, Zhihong; Wang, Hualin",J Mol Cell Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/fb14cf418a25327b21b3033cce20ec862f622e65.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107466.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107466/,

A further 28 infants were then treated with PHY (January 1994–April 1996). Demographic and physiological data were collected from admission, and outcome variables including length of stay, barotrauma and mortality were recorded.

According to the WHO definition, lymph nodes involved by NLPHL should have a nodular or nodular and diffuse proliferation of scattered large neoplastic lymphocyte-predominant (LP) cells in a small cell background that reside in expanded follicular dendritic cell meshworks; the LP cells must also have a distinct immunophenotypic profile. The LP cells are monoclonal B cells that are typically CD20, BCL6, CD79a, and CD45 positive and are CD30 and CD15 negative. In contrast, the Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) are typically positive for CD15 and CD30. However, in CHL, CD20 staining is variable, and CD15 staining may be absent in some cases. Thus, CD30 is often considered to be the most distinctive marker between CHL and NLPHL. In order to better assess CD30 staining in NLPHL, we reviewed 220 cases of NLPHL and found 21 cases that showed at least focal staining of the neoplastic cells for CD30. The CD30 staining was often faint, but occasionally strong, and typically was found only on a subset of the LP cells. We evaluated the clinicopathologic features of these cases to determine whether they showed differences from typical CD30-negative NLPHL and found no significant difference with respect to clinical presentation, histology, other immunophenotypic features or outcome. In summary, we conclude that CD30 expression by LP cells in NLPHL can be seen and should not lead to a misdiagnosis of CHL. The presence of CD30-positive LP cells is not associated with other features of CHL or unusually aggressive behavior.",2011-07-23,"Seliem, Rania M.; Ferry, Judith A.; Hasserjian, Robert P.; Harris, Nancy L.; Zukerberg, Lawrence R.",J Hematop,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c0ef075386412f1d04945f2d06db61817eb8b13c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102138.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102138/,

The research objective is to develop a Saudi e-health literacy scale (SeHL) for measuring e-health literacy among Saudis suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCD). METHODS: Overall, 14 relevant papers in related interdisciplinary fields were reviewed to select the most useful literacy dimensions. From these articles, we extracted the most common dimensions used to measure e-health literacy across the disciplines. Multiple workshops with multidisciplinary team members reviewed and evaluated items for SeHL. RESULTS: Four key aspects of e-health literacy—use of technology/media, information-seeking, usefulness and confidence—were identified and integrated as e-health literacy dimensions. These will be used to measure e-health literacy among Saudi patients with NCDs. A translation from Arabic to English was performed in order to ensure that translation process was accurate. A SeHL scale was developed to measure e-health literacy among Saudi patients. By understanding e-health literacy levels, we will be able to create a patient-education system to be used by patients in Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSIONS: As information technology is increasingly used by people of all ages all over the world, e-health literacy has been identified as a key factor in determining health outcomes.

We show here that this nuclear localisation is directly associated with regulation of CTS1 expression. Using a version of Ace2p tagged with a c-myc epitope, we show that the protein is excluded from the nucleus of cells during most phases of the mitotic cell cycle. A mutant derivative in which one threonine and two serine residues, which are candidate phosphorylation sites, were replaced by alanine (to mimic constitutive dephosphorylation) is localised in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. The mechanism of localisation of Ace2p therefore involves regulation of its phosphorylation state, and closely resembles that used by the homologous transcription factor Swi5p. The wild-type Ace2 protein associates with Cdc28p in vivo, suggesting this may be the kinase that mediates the phosphorylation event. The stability of the protein is greatly reduced in a mutant that is constitutively localised to the nucleus, but is restored in a deletion derivative which remains in the cytoplasm.

In this study, we analyzed the integrity, sources, and stability of salivary RNA. Methods: We measured the integrity of salivary RNA with reverse transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) or RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). To study RNA entry sites into the oral cavity, we used RT-PCR analysis of salivary RNA from the 3 major salivary glands, gingival crevice fluid, and desquamated oral epithelial cells. We measured stability of the salivary β-actin mRNA by RT-qPCR of salivary RNA incubated at room temperature for different periods of time. We measured RNA association with other macromolecules by filtering saliva through pores of different sizes before performing RT-qPCR. To assess RNA–macromolecule interaction, we incubated saliva with Triton X-100 for different periods of time before performing RT-qPCR. Results: In most cases, we detected partial- to full-length salivary mRNAs and smaller amounts of middle and 3′ gene amplicons compared with the 5′. RNA was present in all oral fluids examined. Endogenous salivary β-actin mRNA degraded more slowly than exogenous β-actin mRNA, with half-lives of 12.2 and 0.4 min, respectively (P <0.001). Salivary RNA could not pass through 0.22 or 0.45 μm pores. Incubation of saliva with Triton X-100 accelerated degradation of salivary RNA.

Indeed, heparanase displays a unique versatility in degrading heparan sulfate chains of several proteoglycans expressed in all mammalian cells. This endo-β-D-glucuronidase is overexpressed in cancer, inflammation, diabetes, atherosclerosis, nephropathies and other pathologies. Starting from known low- or non-anticoagulant heparins, the search for heparanase inhibitors evolved focusing on structure-activity relationship studies and taking advantage of new chemical-physical analytical methods which have allowed characterization and sequencing of polysaccharide chains. New methods to screen heparanase inhibitors and to evaluate their mechanism of action and in vivo activity in experimental models prompted their development. New non-anticoagulant heparin derivatives endowed with anti-heparanase activity are reported.

One-third of respondents ranked HBV as a key health issue in the Asian community, second to diabetes. General HBV awareness is high (85%); however, a majority could not name an effective prevention method. Sixty percent reported having been tested for HBV; provider recommendation was the most often cited reason for testing. Respondents reported a high level of trust in their providers to correctly assess which health issues they may be at risk for developing and test accordingly, confirming that efforts to increase HBV testing among Asians must simultaneously mobilize the public to request testing and compel providers to test high-risk patients. Regarding community awareness, more than half reported hearing more about HBV recently; younger respondents were more likely to have encountered campaign materials and recall correct HBV facts. Assessment of specific campaign materials found that while upbeat images and taglines captured attention and destigmatized HBV, messages that emphasize the pervasiveness and deadly consequence of infection were more likely to drive respondents to seek education and testing.

Moreover, putative constitutive modifying enzyme activities were suspected to be carried out by homologous viral proteins (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, methyl/guanylyl transferase, NTPase). These findings, together with the comparative analysis to genomes of south-east Asian isolates, support the recent classification of arboviruses with 12 segments of dsRNA within two distinct genera (genus Coltivirus and genus Seadornavirus) and raise interesting questions about the evolutionary origins of coltiviruses. The previously proposed hypothesis that EYA virus was derived from an ancestral virus introduced in Europe with the migration of lagomorphs from North-America, would imply a divergence date between American and European isolates of over 50 million years ago (MYA).

Aquatic bryophytes were sampled from 108 streams spanning over 3000 m of altitude in four regions of Nepal. Richness, cover and community composition were related to physicochemistry using multiple regression, DECORANA ordination and TWINSPAN. The performance of a hierarchically scaled descriptive model, developed in New Zealand for predicting bryophyte distribution, was examined in this highly heterogeneous Himalayan region. 2. Community composition and cover varied highly significantly with altitude, streambed stability and alkalinity, with evidence of effects of riparian land use on bryophyte cover. Cover was greatest in streams at low to middle altitudes with steep slopes (> 15°), high stability and low conductivity (< 60 μS cm(–1)), where communities were dominated by two Isopterygium spp., two Philonotis spp., Mnium punctatum and Lejeuneaceae. 3. Richness, by contrast, increased significantly but weakly at high altitude and moderate stability, where streams were dominated by Eurynchium praelongum, Rhynchostegium spp., Fissidens grandifrons and Hygroamblystegium spp. Richness and cover were lowest in unstable streams at the lowest altitude, where no single taxon was consistently most abundant. 4. Although these results were similar to those in the descriptive model developed for bryophytes in New Zealand, subtle differences were apparent. Substrate size, although influencing the presence of bryophytes in New Zealand streams, appeared to be unimportant in Nepal. By contrast, streambed stability was more important in Nepal than New Zealand, perhaps reflecting pronounced monsoonal floods, and subsequent increased frequency of bed movement in the former.

32o6cwhu,,PMC,The Application of Internet-Based Sources for Public Health Surveillance (Infoveillance): Systematic Review,10.2196/13680,PMC7101503,32167477,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: Public health surveillance is based on the continuous and systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. This informs the development of early warning systems to monitor epidemics and documents the impact of intervention measures. The introduction of digital data sources, and specifically sources available on the internet, has impacted the field of public health surveillance. New opportunities enabled by the underlying availability and scale of internet-based sources (IBSs) have paved the way for novel approaches for disease surveillance, exploration of health communities, and the study of epidemic dynamics. This field and approach is also known as infodemiology or infoveillance. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to assess research findings regarding the application of IBSs for public health surveillance (infodemiology or infoveillance). To achieve this, we have presented a comprehensive systematic literature review with a focus on these sources and their limitations, the diseases targeted, and commonly applied methods. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted targeting publications between 2012 and 2018 that leveraged IBSs for public health surveillance, outbreak forecasting, disease characterization, diagnosis prediction, content analysis, and health-topic identification. The search results were filtered according to previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Spanning a total of 162 publications, we determined infectious diseases to be the preferred case study (108/162, 66.7%). Of the eight categories of IBSs (search queries, social media, news, discussion forums, websites, web encyclopedia, and online obituaries), search queries and social media were applied in 95.1% (154/162) of the reviewed publications. We also identified limitations in representativeness and biased user age groups, as well as high susceptibility to media events by search queries, social media, and web encyclopedias. CONCLUSIONS: IBSs are a valuable proxy to study illnesses affecting the general population; however, it is important to characterize which diseases are best suited for the available sources; the literature shows that the level of engagement among online platforms can be a potential indicator. There is a necessity to understand the population’s online behavior; in addition, the exploration of health information dissemination and its content is significantly unexplored. With this information, we can understand how the population communicates about illnesses online and, in the process, benefit public health.",2020-03-13,"Barros, Joana M; Duggan, Jim; Rebholz-Schuhmann, Dietrich",J Med Internet Res,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101503.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101503/,

The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic or mild infection to severe dehydrating illness with a fatal outcome; the latter occurs primarily in young children and in the elderly. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the prevention and treatment of gastroenteritis. For the prevention of epidemic viral gastroenteritis, efforts need to be focused on caliciviruses. No specific antiviral therapy is recommended for childhood viral gastroenteritis, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing it from the selected forms of bacterial and parasitic gastroenteritis that require treatment. Other than pertinent epidemiologic information, certain clinical features of illness may provide etiologic clues, but they are not highly discriminating.

During the follow-up period until day +100, pulmonary complications and lung function were assessed. Before HSCT, the mean FeNO levels were comparable in children with or without post-transplant pulmonary complications.

These features constitute major determinants of virion stability in the environment and virion resistance against physical and chemical agents. Reovirus (ReoV) is the general term most commonly used for all virus strains that infect humans and nonhuman animals. Several studies have demonstrated the frequent occurrence of ReoV in wastewaters and natural waters, including surface and ground waters from different geographical areas. Most of these studies have reported higher concentrations of ReoV than any other enteric virus analyzed. They are more commonly isolated in chlorine-disinfected wastewaters than other enteric viruses, and appear to survive longer in water. The ability of ReoV to form large aggregates, even with different types of enteric viruses (e.g., poliovirus) and their ability to undergo mechanisms of gene segment reassortment among different serotypes may also explain their greater stability. Different approaches have been applied for concentration of ReoV from water; however, the recovery efficiency of the filtration methods has not been fully evaluated. Recently, molecular methods for identification of ReoV strains and quantification of virus genome have been developed. Studies have shown that the overall detection sensitivity of ReoV RNA is enhanced through initial replication of infectious virions in cell culture. More studies are needed to specifically address unresolved issues about the fate and distribution of ReoV in the environment since this virus is not commonly included in virological investigations.",2016-06-18,"Betancourt, Walter Q.; Gerba, Charles P.",Food Environ Virol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b579dd066bd55d6171418e03834661e96f90ae67.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091427.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091427/,

Two different variants of female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The two variants differed in daily weight gain (0.38 g/day vs. 1.41 g/day during 28 days), and were designated slowly and rapidly growing rats (SGR and RGR) respectively. Oxytocin 1 mg/kg given s.c. to SGR for a five-day period increased weight gain significantly in comparison to a previous five-day period with NaCl-treatment (18.0 g/5 days versus 5.0 g/5 days; p<0.01). In a separate study, oxytocin 1 mg/kg given for four days increased weight gain significantly in SGR versus saline-treated controls (7.5 g/4 days versus 1.6 g/4 days; p<0.05). The weight-difference persisted six days later (p<0.001). The weight increase of oxytocin occurred only during estrus (p<0.05) and was not accompanied by any measurable increase in food intake. In RGR, oxytocin-treatment decreased food intake significantly (p<0.001) and tended to decrease weight gain, although not significantly. The SGR and RGR also had different endocrine profiles with, for example, twice as high oxytocin (p<0.01) and insulin levels (p<0.01) in RGR compared to the SGR. These data suggest that oxytocin influences weight gain and food intake differently in the two variants of Sprague-Dawley rats, perhaps depending on factors such as endocrine profile and oxytocin sensitivity.",1996,"Uvnas-Moberg, Kerstin; Alster, Pawel; Petersson, Maria",Integr Physiol Behav Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/775db7ba1614cbac8c651fa74d6c3fd65c96caea.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090716/,

The transmission dynamics of adenovirus have never been well understood, which complicates prevention efforts MethodsEnrollment and end-of-study samples were obtained and active surveillance for febrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) was performed for 341 recruits and support personnel. Environmental samples were collected simultaneously. Classic and advanced diagnostic techniques were used ResultsSeventy-nine percent (213/271) of new recruits were seronegative for either adenovirus serotype 4 (Ad-4) or adenovirus serotype 7 (Ad-7). FRI caused by Ad-4 was observed in 25% (67/271) of enrolled recruits, with 100% of them occurring in individuals with enrollment titers <1:4. The percentage of recruits seropositive for Ad-4 increased from 34% at enrollment to 97% by the end of the study. Adenovirus was most commonly detected in the environment on pillows, lockers, and rifles ConclusionsPotential sources of adenovirus transmission among US military recruits included the presence of adenovirus on surfaces in living quarters and extended pharyngeal viral shedding over the course of several days.

We have used a recombinant retroviral expression vector encoding anglerfish prepro-SRIF-I to infect rat pituitary GH(3) cells. The aim of these studies was to investigate the intracellular storage and secretion of the total pool of endogenous GH compared to that of SRIF. Several clonal lines of GH(3) cells expressing high or low levels of SRIF were treated with TRH, forskolin, or depolarizing concentrations of potassium, and the levels of intracellular and secreted GH or SRIF were determined using highly sensitive RIAs. Approximately 65% of the total GH was secreted basally, whereas less than 20% of the SRIF-immunoreactive material was basally secreted. Forskolin treatment or potassium depolarization stimulated GH release, but only about 50% above basal levels. In contrast, SRIF secretion was stimulated approximately 5-fold in response to these secretagogues.

We sought to determine whether an automated electronic medical record best practice alert (BPA) based on procalcitonin and respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results could help reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in patients with likely viral respiratory illness. METHODS: This multisite, pre–post, quasi-experimental study included patients 18 years and older with a procalcitonin level <0.25 ng/mL and a virus identified on respiratory PCR within 48 hours of each other, and 1 or more systemic antibiotics ordered. In the study group, a BPA alerted providers of the diagnostic results suggesting viral infection and prompted them to reassess the need for antibiotics. The primary outcome measured was total antibiotic-days of therapy. RESULTS: The BPA reduced inpatient antibiotic-days of therapy by a mean of 2.2 days compared with patients who met criteria but did not have the alert fire (8.0 vs 5.8 days, respectively, P < .001). The BPA also reduced the percentage of patients prescribed antibiotics on discharge (20% vs 47.8%, P < .001), whereas there was no difference in need for antibiotic escalation after initial discontinuation (7.6% vs 4.3%, P = .198).

Western blot analysis failed to detect uncoupling protein in the tumors. The elevated respiratory enzyme activities were paralleled by an increase in the mitochondrial DNA content.

Toward the development of a plant-based expression system for the production of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) p24 capsid protein, the p24 gene was introduced into the genome of tobacco plants using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer. Southern blot analyses confirmed the presence of the p24 coding sequence within the genome of transgenic lines. Western blot analysis of protein extracts from transgenic plants identified plant-expressed p24 protein that cross-reacted with a p24-specific monoclonal antibody, thus confirming the maintenance of antigenicity. Quantification of the p24 protein using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) estimated yields of approx 3.5 mg per g of soluble leaf protein. Similar accumulation levels of p24 were also detected in T1 plants, confirming that the p24 gene is transmitted stably.

It is clear that pathogenic agents causing overt disease represent a serious hazard to research results in both short- as well as long-term studies. However, these organisms may contaminate colonies without causing any clinical or pathological symptom. This makes research less reliable because of the more subtle effects of the silent infections, especially in long-term studies as in aging research. The establishment of animal colonies that were free from these (micro-) organisms has increased substantially the value of animals used in biomedical research. Characterization of the health status and microbiological monitoring of the animals in experiments are particularly important. This paper reviews many of the major considerations in the efforts to maintain animals free of unwanted organisms, including quality and sources of animals, transportation and quarantine, maintenance during experimentation, microbiological characterization and monitoring of animals and environment.

However, the barrier to the development of peptide-based vaccines with maximum population coverage is that the restricting HLA genes are extremely polymorphic resulting in a vast diversity of peptide-binding HLA specificities and a low population coverage for any given peptide–HLA specificity. One way to reduce this complexity is to group thousands of different HLA molecules into several so-called HLA supertypes: a classification that refers to a group of HLA alleles with largely overlapping peptide binding specificities.

We also determined to what extent typical xerophilic species assemblages still exist. Pitfall trapping at 28 study sites in northwestern Germany yielded 111 carabid species that were grouped using Kendall's W coefficient of concordance. Ordination revealed that the differences between the four species groups resulted from vegetation cover and soil humidity, indicating that carabid distribution clearly reflects degradation processes. Our results suggest that areas in which succession proceeds were unsuitable for assemblages typical of dry grasslands and heathlands.

In this work we employ the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to investigate the adsorption of RNA onto positively charged spherical viral shells and examine the conditions when GSDA does not apply and SCFT has to be used to obtain a reliable solution. We find that there are two regimes in which GSDA does work. First, when the genomic RNA length is long enough compared to the capsid radius, and second, when the interaction between the genome and capsid is so strong that the genome is basically localized next to the wall. We find that for the case in which RNA is more or less distributed uniformly in the shell, regardless of the length of RNA, GSDA is not a good approximation. We observe that as the polymer–shell interaction becomes stronger, the energy gap between the ground state and first excited state increases and thus GSDA becomes a better approximation.

Our strategy includes the prediction of selective interactions, developing structure, and knowledge-based selective pharmacophore models, followed by database screening and molecular docking. This unique strategy was employed in addressing the off-target toxicity of Gsk3β and CDKs. The connections of Gsk3β in eukaryotic cell apoptosis and the extensive potency of Gsk3β inhibitors to block cell death have made it a potential drug-discovery target for many grievous human disorders. Gsk3β is phylogenetically very closely related to the CDKs, such as CDK1 and CDK2, which are suggested to be the off-target proteins of Gsk3β inhibitors. Here, we have employed novel computational approaches in designing the ligand candidates that are potentially inhibitory against Gsk3β, with well-defined the exclusion ability to CDKs. A structure-ligand -based selective pharmacophore was modeled. This model was used to retrieve molecules from the zinc database. The hits retrieved were further screened by molecular docking and protein–ligand interaction fingerprints. Based on these results, four molecules were predicted as selective Gsk3β antagonists.

In this paper, we consider compartmental susceptible–infectious–susceptible (SIS) and susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) models that are slowly forced through a critical transition. We derive expressions for the behavior of several candidate indicators, including the autocorrelation coefficient, variance, coefficient of variation, and power spectra of SIS and SIR epidemics during the approach to emergence or elimination. We validated these expressions using individual-based simulations. We further showed that moving-window estimates of these quantities may be used for anticipating critical transitions in infectious disease systems. Although leading indicators of elimination were highly predictive, we found the approach to emergence to be much more difficult to detect.

The risk of infection spreading in their home country is then estimated supposing the visitors are submitted to the same force of infection as the local population but do not contribute to it. In the second model (disease exportation), it is calculated the probability that an individual from the endemic (or epidemic) country travels to a disease-free country in the condition of latent infected and eventually introduces the infection there. The input of both models is the force of infection at the visited/source country, assumed known. The models are deterministic, but a preliminary stochastic formulation is presented as an appendix.

METHODS: Twelve critically ill pregnant and postpartum women were included in this retrospective observational study on the application of ECMO for the treatment of severe ARDS refractory to standard treatment. The study was conducted at seven tertiary hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients treated with ECMO, 7 (58%) were pregnant and 5 (42%) were postpartum. Their median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 29 (26–33) years, 6 (50%) were obese. Two patients were initially treated with veno-arterial (VA) ECMO. All others received veno-venous (VV) ECMO with one or two drainage cannulae. ECMO circuit-related complications were rare, circuit change was needed in only two cases and there was no sudden circuit failure. On the other hand, bleeding was common, leading to relatively large volumes of packed red blood cell transfusion (median [IQR] volume transfused was 3,499 [1,451–4,874] ml) and was the main cause of death (three cases). Eight (66%) patients survived to discharge and seven were ambulant, with normal oxygen saturations. The survival rate of infants whose mothers received ECMO was 71% and surviving infants were discharged home with no sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ECMO for severe ARDS in pregnant and postpartum women was associated with a 66% survival rate. The most common cause of death was bleeding. Infants delivered of mothers who had received ECMO had a 71% survival rate and, like their mothers, had no permanent sequelae at hospital discharge.

We assessed the benefits and harms of AT III in critically ill patients. METHODS: We searched from inception to 27 August 2015 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CAB, BIOSIS and CINAHL. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of publication status, date of publication, blinding status, outcomes published or language. RESULTS: We included 30 RCTs with a total of 3933 participants. The majority of included trials were at high risk of bias. Combining all trials, regardless of bias, showed no statistically significant effect of AT III on mortality (RR 0.95, 95 % CI 0.88–1.03, I (2) = 0 %, fixed-effect model, 29 trials, 3882 participants). Among those with severe sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), AT III showed no impact on mortality (RR 0.95, 95 % Cl 0.88–1.03, I (2) = 0 %, fixed-effect model, 12 trials, 2858 participants). We carried out multiple subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the benefits and harms of AT III and to examine the impact of risk of bias. AT III significantly increased bleeding events (RR 1.58, 95 % CI 1.35–1.84, I (2) = 0 %, fixed-effect model, 11 trials, 3019 participants). However, for all other outcome measures and analyses, the results did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support AT III substitution in any category of critically ill participants including those with sepsis and DIC. AT III did not show an impact on mortality, but increased the risk of bleeding.

Presatovir treatment, compared with the placebo treatment, did not significantly affect (prespecified α = 0.01) a time-weighted average decline in the RSV viral load from Day 1 to 9 (treatment difference, −0.33 log(10) copies/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] −.64 to −.02 log(10) copies/mL; P = .040) or the progression to LRTC (11.2% vs 19.5%, respectively; odds ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, .22–1.18; P = .11). In a post hoc analysis among patients with lymphopenia, presatovir decreased LRTC development by Day 28 (2/15 [13.3%] vs 9/14 [64.3%], respectively; P = .008), compared with the placebo. Adverse events were similar for patients receiving presatovir and the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Presatovir had a favorable safety profile in adult HCT recipients with RSV but did not achieve the coprimary endpoints. Exploratory analyses suggest an antiviral effect among patients with lymphopenia.

The sequence of its 18 N terminal amino acids was determined and found to be very similar to that of mammalian aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2). Indeed aminopeptidase N activity was efficiently immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody 180K1. The purified antigen gives a broad band at 180 kDa after SDS-gel electrophoresis, which, after treatment by endoglycosidase F, is converted to a thinner band at 140 kDa. This antigen is therefore heavily glycosylated. Depending on solubilization conditions, both the antigen and peptidase activity were recovered either as a broad peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 18S (2% CHAPS) or as a single peak of 7.8S (1% CHAPS plus 0.2 % C(12)E(9)), showing that Torpedo aminopeptidase N behaves as an oligomer stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, easily converted into a 160 kDa monomer.

The aims of our study were to assess left ventricular (LV) dynamic myocardial deformation and diastolic reserve at rest and upon exercise, along with OB determination in this patients subset. METHODS: Conventional echocardiography, Doppler myocardial imaging and LV 2D speckle tracking echocardiography were performed in 55 OSA patients with preserved LV ejection fraction (EF) and 35 age and sex-comparable healthy controls. Peripheral OB levels were evaluated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Despite comparable LVEF, LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) was significantly reduced in OSA at rest (− 13.4 ± 3.8 vs − 18.4 ± 3.3 in controls, P < 0.001) and at peak exercise (− 15.8 ± 2.6 vs − 23.4 ± 4.3, P < 0.001). Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) and E/E′ ratios increase during effort were higher in OSA than in controls (ΔsPAP 44.3% ± 6.4 vs 32.3% ± 5.5, P < 0.0001, and ΔE/E’ 87.5% ± 3.5 vs 25.4% ± 3.3, P < 0.0001, respectively). The best correlate of E/E′ at peak stress was peak exertion capacity (r = − 0.50, P < 0.001). OB was also increased in OSA patients (P = 0.001) but, unlike OSA severity, was not associated with LV diastolic dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of diastolic function and myocardial deformation during exercise is feasible through stress echocardiography. OSA patients with preserved LVEF show subclinical LV systolic dysfunction, impaired LV systolic and diastolic reserve, reduced exercise tolerance, and increased peripheral levels of OB. Therapy aimed at increasing LV diastolic function reserve might improve the quality of life and exercise tolerability in OSA patients.",2020-03-29,"D’Andrea, Antonello; Canora, Angelo; Sperlongano, Simona; Galati, Domenico; Zanotta, Serena; Polistina, Giorgio Emanuele; Nicoletta, Carmine; Ghinassi, Giacomo; Galderisi, Maurizio; Zamparelli, Alessandro Sanduzzi; Lancellotti, Patrizio; Bocchino, Marialuisa",BMC Pulm Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3c7ada8bfcdce6b47c8ad3fa6cdc22dcf0d1fe0c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103071.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103071/,

Selected members of a set of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific for each of four major isotypes of bovine Ig constant regions, one specific for anti-bovine Ig constant regions as well as one specific for anti-bovine light chains are discussed. Interspecific fusion of bovine lymphocytes with the established mouse cell line, SP2/0 was used to produce a collection of stable hybridomas among which were found secretors of bovine IgG1, IgG2, IgM, IgA and bovine light chain. Interspecific fusion of SP2/0 with lymphocytes from a multiparous Holstein four days post immunization with Streptococcus agalactiae yielded MAb with specificity for the immunizing antigen. One of these hybridomas, LHRB 19.17, which displayed a particularly stable secretory phenotype, was used as an immunogen for the production of a library of murine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies. Competitive antigen binding analysis showed that 15 of the 24 anti-LHRB 19.17 idiotype antibodies isolated blocked the binding of the idiotype to its nominal antigen and so were candidates for evaluation as antigen mimics.

The pattern of sequence variation in felids supports the role of the following factors in production and maintenance of MHC variation: (1) gradual spontaneous mutation; (2) selective pressure to conserve certain residues but also to vary in hypervariable regions, notably residues that functionally participate in antigen recognition and presentation; and (3) recombination-mediated gene exchange between alleles and between related genes. The overall amount of genetic variation observed among MHC class I genes in the Felidae family is no greater than the amount of variation within any outbred cat species (i.e., domestic cat, ocelot). The occurrence of equivalent levels of polymorphism plus the simultaneous persistence of the same sequence motifs in divergent feline species suggest that most MHC class I nucleotide site polymorphism predated species divergences. Ancient polymorphisms have been transmitted through the speciation events and modern feline MHC class I alleles were derived by recombinational exchange of polymorphic sequence motifs. Moreover, some of these sequence motifs were found in other mammalian MHC class I genes, such as classical human HLA-B5, nonclassical human HLA-E class I genes, and bovine class I genes. These results raise the prospect of an ancient origin for some motifs, although the possibility of convergence in parallel mammalian radiations cannot be excluded.",1994,"Yuhki, Naoya; O'Brien, Stephen J.",J Mol Evol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e569bb0db1732e6760719f72536980df57851da4.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087520/,

However, how CPV-2 participates in cell regulation and immune response remains unknown. In this study, persistently infected MDCK cells were generated through culture passage of the CPV-2a-infected cells for ten generations. Our study showed that CPV-2a induces cell proliferation arrest and cell morphology alternation before the fourth generation, whereas, the cell morphology returns to normal after five times of passages. PCR detection of viral VP2 gene demonstrated that CPV-2a proliferate with cell passage. An immunofluorescence assay revealed that CPV-2a particles were mainly located in the cell nuclei of MDCK cell. Then transcriptome microarray revealed that gene expression pattern of MDCK with CPV-2a persistent infection is distinct compared with normal cells. Gene ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway analysis demonstrated that CPV-2a infection induces a series of membrane-associated genes expression, including many MHC protein or MHC-related complexes. These genes are closely related to signaling pathways of virus–host interaction, including antigen processing and presentation pathway, intestinal immune network, graft-versus-host disease, and RIG-I-like helicases signaling pathway. In contrast, the suppressed genes mediated by CPV-2a showed low enrichment in any category, and were only involved in pathways linking to synthesis and metabolism of amino acids, which was confirmed by qPCR analysis.

The goal of this investigation is to examine the relationship between fluid resuscitation rate and septic shock resolution. METHOD: We retrospectively studied adult (≥ 18 years) patients with septic shock, defined based on sepsis III definition, from January 1, 2006, through May 31, 2018, in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of Mayo Clinic Rochester. The fluid resuscitation time was defined as the time required to infuse the initial fluid bolus of 30 ml/kg, based on the recommendations of the 2016 surviving sepsis campaign. The cohort was divided into four groups based on the average fluid rate (group 1 ≥ 0.5, group 2 0.25–0.49, group 3 0.17–0.24, and group 4 < 0.17 ml/kg/min). The primary outcome was the time to shock reversal. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to account for potential confounders. RESULT: A total of 1052 patients met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The time-to-shock reversal was significantly different among the groups (P < .001). Patients in group 1 who received fluid resuscitation at a faster rate had a shorter time to shock reversal (HR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.66–0.91; P = .01) when compared with group 4 with a median (IQR) time-to-shock reversal of 1.7 (1.5, 2.0) vs. 2.8 (2.6, 3.3) days, respectively. Using 0.25 ml/kg/min as cutoff, the higher fluid infusion rate was associated with a shorter time to shock reversal (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.06–1.41; P = .004) and with decreased odds of 28-day mortality (HR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.60–0.85; P < .001). CONCLUSION: In septic shock patients, initial fluid resuscitation rate of 0.25–0.50 ml/kg/min (i.e., completion of the initial 30 ml/kg IV fluid resuscitation within the first 2 h), may be associated with early shock reversal and lower 28-day mortality compared with slower rates of infusion.",2020-04-07,"Hu, Bo; Chen, Joy C.

Thus, the prevalence and clinical importance of virus infections and the need for antiviral drugs differ from place to place and from time to time. National and World Health Statistics of notifications of disease give some index of the incidence of infections but not all virus infections are notifiable. Such statistics can be misleading also through failures to notify from sloth on the part of the physician or, in the absence of pathognomonic symptoms or signs, from errors in diagnosis. Any assessment of the need for new antiviral drugs should consider the availability, safety, effectiveness and cost of alternative measures, including prevention of spread of infection by control of vectors, immunization by use of viral vaccines, or treatment with existing antiviral drugs. Early start of treatment of acute virus infections with existing drugs gives the best results and, where the clinical diagnosis is uncertain, accurate rapid virus diagnosis is of paramount importance. Many virus infections are asymptomatic or of trivial importance and without sequelae. However, new or improved antiviral drugs are needed for the prevention and/or treatment of a number of significant conditions caused by viruses which are not at present adequately controlled. These include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, influenza, chronic hepatitis, gastroenteritis, infectious mononucleosis, measles, rabies, haemorrhagic fevers and warts.

Six region of interest (ROI) patterns were adopted: ROI 1 was outlined around the entire hemithorax, and ROIs 2–6 were outlined around the hemithorax but excluded square ROIs of different size in the hilar region. Half-times (T(½)) were calculated with time-activity curves using onecompartment and two-compartment analyses. The T(½) of ROIs 1–5 were plotted against the T(½) of ROI 6, and regression lines were obtained with the least-squares method. The absolute values of the differences between surveyed values and regression line were calculated. The Wilcoxon test for trend and a single linear regression model were used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: There were significant reductions in the absolute values of the differences between surveyed values and regression line from ROIs 1–5 by one-component analysis and the fast component of two-compartment analysis (P < 0.001).

We evaluated presatovir in hematopoietic-cell transplant (HCT) recipients with RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS: Patients with confirmed RSV in upper and lower respiratory tract and new chest X-ray abnormalities were randomized (1:1), stratified by supplemental oxygen and ribavirin use, to receive oral presatovir 200 mg or placebo every 4 days for 5 doses. The primary endpoint was time-weighted average change in nasal RSV viral load through day 9. Secondary endpoints included supplemental oxygen-free days, incident respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: From January 31, 2015, to March 20, 2017, 60 patients from 17 centers were randomized (31 presatovir, 29 placebo); 59 received study treatment (50 allogeneic, 9 autologous HCT). In the efficacy population (29 presatovir, 28 placebo), presatovir treatment did not significantly reduce time-weighted average change in viral load (−1.12 vs −1.09 log(10) copies/mL; treatment difference −0.02 log(10) copies/mL, 95% confidence interval: −.62, .57; P = .94), median supplemental oxygen-free days (26 vs 28 days, P = .84), incident respiratory failure (10.3 vs 10.7%, P = .98), or all-cause mortality (0 vs 7.1%, P = .19) versus placebo.

Dynamic features were revealed through time-lapse video recording and aspects of macrophage function were assessed. The two cell forms were shown to be different pre-mitotic stages of a single cell type. The cell cycle for these cells involved an initial large, flat, quiescent cell which retracted to yield a slightly rounded form with numerous processes. This latter form lost processes and developed profuse filopodia as it became very rounded just prior to division; both resulting daughter cells then regained the initial large flat appearance. These cells possessed several properties of macrophages, including phagocytosis, nucleoside diphosphatase enzyme, and CR3 receptors. These properties were transient, expressed just before and after mitosis, but subsequently down-regulated in the flat daughter cells. Because of this feature, it was difficult to determine the exact size of this cell population; however, the observed rate of proliferation suggests it may be substantial. It is suggested that these cells correspond to non-microglial macrophages of brain tissue and, because of their significant down-regulation, they may be difficult to detect.

METHODS: Mice were randomly divided into control, LPS, and crocin + LPS (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg) groups. HUVECs were separated into eight groups: control, crocin, matrix metalloproteinase 9 inhibitor (MMP-9 inhib), cathepsin L inhibitor (CTL inhib), LPS, MMP-9 inhib + LPS, CTL inhib + LPS, and crocin + LPS. The potential cytotoxic effect of crocin on HUVECs was mainly evaluated through methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. Histological changes were assessed via hemotoxylin and eosin staining. Lung capillary permeability was detected on the basis of wet–dry ratio and through fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin assay. Then, protein levels were detected through Western blot analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: This study showed that crocin can improve the pulmonary vascular permeability in mice with LPS-induced ARDS and inhibit the inflammatory signaling pathways of high mobility group box, nuclear factor κB, and mitogen-activated protein kinase in vivo and in vitro. Crocin also protected against the degradation of endothelial glycocalyx heparan sulfate and syndecan-4 by inhibiting the expressions of CTL, heparanase, and MMP-9 in vivo and in vitro.

Concerning translation, viruses most often violate Kozak's original rule that eukaryotic translation starts from a capped monocistronic mRNA and involves linear scanning to find the first suitable start codon. Thus, many viral cases have been described where translation is initiated from noncapped RNA, using an internal ribosome entry site. This review centers on other viral translation strategies, namely shunting and virus-controlled reinitiation as first described in plant pararetroviruses (Caulimoviridae). In shunting, major parts of a complex leader are bypassed and not melted by scanning ribosomes. In the Caulimoviridae, this process is coupled to reinitiation after translation of a small open reading frame; in other cases, it is possibly initiated upon pausing of the scanning ribosome. Most of the Caulimoviridae produce polycistronic mRNAs. Two basic mechanisms are used for their translation. Alternative translation of the downstream open reading frames in the bacilliform Caulimoviridae occurs by a leaky scanning mechanism, and reinitiation of polycistronic translation in many of the icosahedral Caulimoviridae is enabled by the action of a viral transactivator. Both of these processes are discussed here in detail and compared to related processes in other viruses and cells.",2004-01-07,"Ryabova, Lyubov A; Pooggin, Mikhail M; Hohn, Thomas",Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8d884680783a659485086fa05094495051e00f98.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133299/,

Because inflammation is usually associated with oxidative stress, we investigated the effect of ExoU on free radical production and antioxidant defense mechanisms during the course of P. aeruginosa infection. In an experimental model of acute pneumonia, ExoU accounted for increased lipid peroxidation in mice lungs as soon as 3 h after intratracheal instillation of PA103 P. aeruginosa strain. The contribution of airway cells to the generation of a redox imbalance was assessed by in vitro tests carried out with A549 airway epithelial cells. Cultures infected with the ExoU-producing PA103 P. aeruginosa strain produced significantly increased concentrations of lipid hydroperoxides, 8-isoprostane, reactive oxygen intermediates, peroxynitrite and nitric oxide (NO), when compared to cells infected with exoU-deficient mutants. Overproduction of NO by PA103-infected cells likely resulted from overexpression of both inducible and endothelial NO synthase isoforms.

RECENT FINDINGS: Acute HBVinfection and acute exacerbations of chronic HBVinfection can cause acute liver injury (ALI) or fulminant hepatitis (FH). Spontaneous survival at this stage is poor. It is urgent to distinguish between these two entities so that antiviral therapy can be initiated rapidly. Although the indications for antiviral therapy are clear for HBV reactivation, there is no true consensus regarding ALI/FH related to acute HBV infection. The global management of HBV-related FH does not differ from that implemented for other causes of FH, i.e. close cardiorespiratory and neurological monitoring, treatment with acetylcysteine, organ support in the event of organ failure (haemodynamic, renal, respiratory) and albumin dialysis. Liver transplantation remains the only alternative when certain criteria for a poor prognosis are met.

However, their main limitation is rather poor immunogenicity, which makes it necessary to couple the antigens with adjuvant molecules. This paper review recent advances in the development of DNA vaccines to some pathogenic protozoa and helminths. Numerous studies were conducted over the past 14 years of 21(st) century, employing various administration techniques, adjuvants and new immunogenic antigens to increase efficacy of DNA vaccines.

However, the phenotypic impact of genetic variants often remained unclear, thus the rationale of their use in risk prediction may be limited. We therefore analyzed genetic variants together with anthropometric and lifestyle factors to see how these affect mRNA levels of ERCC1 , MDM2 and TP53 in primary blood lymphocytes. mRNA expression was measured in 376 prostate cancer patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription, and ERCC1 rs11615 T>C, ERCC1 rs3212986 C>A, MDM2 rs2279744 T>G and TP53 rs17878362 (p53PIN3) polymorphisms were determined. Considerable interindividual differences in mRNA expression were found (coefficients of variation: ERCC1 , 45%; MDM2 , 43% and TP53 , 35%). ERCC1 expression was positively correlated with plasma levels of β-carotene ( P = 0.03) and negatively correlated with canthaxanthin ( P = 0.02) and lutein ( P = 0.02). Overall, the polymorphisms affected mRNA expression only weakly. Carriers of a distinct ERCC1 haplotype (CC) showed, however, significantly lower expression values than non-carriers ( P = 0.001). Applying logistic regression, we found that CC haplotype carriers had a 1.69-fold increased odds ratio (95% confidence interval: 1.06–2.71) for reduced ERCC1 mRNA levels. This low ERCC1 expression might be associated with reduced DNA repair and better therapy response. In summary, the association we have found between ERCC1 genotype and mRNA expression supports recent clinical observations that genetic variation in ERCC1 can affect treatment outcome and prognosis.

Although its etiopathogenesis is not clearly understood, it is known to be a Nairovirus. We aimed to examine the viral effects of intense systemic inflammation and vascular damage on the pulmonary vascular beds and lung tissues. METHODS: A total of 45 patients who were diagnosed with CCHF were considered for this retrospective study. In this patient group, those whose lungs had been visualized via thoracic computer tomography (CT) were entered into the study. Diameters of the pulmonary trunk, main pulmonary arteries, atria, and ventricles were measured. Study group measurements were compared with the control group, which included patients with normal thoracic CT. RESULTS: Overall, 90 patients were enrolled in the study, with 45 patients in the study group and 45 in the control group. In the study group, the man-to-woman balance was 3/2. The average age in the study group was 54.07 ± 17.91 years. In comparing the average diameters of pulmonary arteries in the study and control groups, the study group’s average pulmonary artery diameter was significantly larger than the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in diameters of the pulmonary trunks and main pulmonary arteries due to CCHF was first shown in this current study. Moreover, due to our findings, it should be noted that with the rise in pulmonary artery diameter in CCHF, pulmonary hypertension can appear acutely, and this condition can be significantly alter clinical course and follow-up of the viral illness.",2016-06-25,"Aktaş, Turan; Aktaş, Fatma; Özmen, Zafer; Kaya, Turan",Lung,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/908229b89e229ffa5e16a89b13a05d843b784bbf.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101793.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101793/,

Critical questions for predicting disease emergence are: (1) what determines when and where a disease will first cross from one species to another, and (2) which factors facilitate emergence after a successful host shift. In wild primates, infectious diseases most often are shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographic region. Therefore, humans may be most vulnerable to diseases from the great apes, which include chimpanzees and gorillas, because these species represent our closest relatives. Geographic overlap may provide the opportunity for cross-species transmission, but successful infection and establishment will be determined by the biology of both the host and pathogen. We extrapolate the evolutionary relationship between pathogen sharing and divergence time between primate species to generate “hotspot” maps, highlighting regions where the risk of disease transfer between wild primates and from wild primates to humans is greatest. We find that central Africa and Amazonia are hotspots for cross-species transmission events between wild primates, due to a high diversity of closely related primate species. Hotspots of host shifts to humans will be most likely in the forests of central and west Africa, where humans come into frequent contact with their wild primate relatives.

Socioeconomic status may play a partial but important role in mortality and recovery. Therefore, the detection of factors that are responsible for poor long-term outcomes would be beneficial in designing targeted interventions for at-risk populations. METHODS: For an endpoint analysis, 1834 intensive care unit patients with known French Deprivation Index (FDep) scores were included from the French and euRopean Outcome reGistry in Intensive Care Units (FROG-ICU) study, which was a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study performed in 20 French intensive care units in 13 different hospitals. Socioeconomic status was defined by using the FDep score [represented as quintiles when referring to the general French population, as quintiles when referring to the FROG-ICU cohort, or as dichotomized data (which was defined as a FDep ≤ 0 for nondeprived patients)] and by using a detailed social questionnaire that was completed 3 months after discharge. The primary outcome included an all-cause, 1-year mortality after ICU discharge when regarding socioeconomic status. The secondary outcomes included both ICU and hospital lengths of stay, both short- and medium-term mortality, and the quality of life, as assessed during the 1-year follow-up by using the Medical Outcome Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36). The Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) was used to evaluate the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to screen for anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Of the 1447 patients who were discharged alive from the ICU, 19.2% died over the following year. No association was found between 1-year mortality and socioeconomic status, regardless of whether this association was analyzed in quintiles (p = 0.911 in the quintiles of the general French population; p = 0.589 in the quintiles of the FROG-ICU cohort itself) or as dichotomized data [nondeprived (n = 177; 1-year mortality of 18.2%) versus deprived (n = 97; 1-year mortality of 20.5%; p = 0.304)]. Moreover, no differences were found between the nondeprived and the deprived patients in the ICU and hospital lengths of stay, ICU mortalities, in-hospital mortalities, or 28-day mortalities. The SF-36 was below the score for the normal French population throughout the follow-up period. Socially deprived patients showed significantly lower median scores in the physical function subscale [55, interquartile range (IQR) (28.8–80) vs. 65, IQR (35–90); p = 0.014], the physical role subscale [25, IQR (0–75) vs. 33.3, IQR (0–100); p = 0.022], and the overall physical component scale [47.5, IQR (30–68.8) vs. 54.4, IQR (35–78.8); p = 0.010]. Up to 31.6% of survivors presented symptoms that indicated post-traumatic stress disorder, and up to 31.5% of survivors reported clinically meaningful symptoms of anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: A lower socioeconomic status was associated with lower self-reported physical component scores in the nondeprived patients. Psychiatric symptoms are frequently reported after an ICU stay, and subsequent interventions should target those fields.

Release of atomic hydrogen from the device has been investigated by the spectroscopic method. Optical emission of atomic hydrogen probably due to recombination of positive ions, H(+)(H(2)O)n, generated from the ceramic plate electrode and electrons emitted from the needle-shaped electrode have been clearly observed in the He gas (including water vapour) environment. The efficacy of the device to reduce airborne concentrations of influenza virus, bacteria, mould fungi and allergens has been evaluated. 99.6% of airborne influenza virus has been deactivated with the operation of the device compared with the control test in a 1 m(3) chamber after 60 min. The neutralization of the OH radical has been investigated by spectroscopic and biological methods. A remarkable reduction of the OH radical in the air by operation of the device has been observed by laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy.

Many cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases use JAKs and STATs to transduce intracellular signals. Mutations in JAK and STAT genes cause a number of immunodeficiency syndromes, and polymorphisms in these genes are associated with autoimmune diseases. The success of small-molecule JAK inhibitors (Jakinibs) in the treatment of rheumatologic disease demonstrates that intracellular signaling pathways can be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity. Tofacitinib, the first rheumatologic Jakinib, is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for rheumatoid arthritis and is currently under investigation for other autoimmune diseases. Many other Jakinibs are in preclinical development or in various phases of clinical trials. This review describes the JAK–STAT pathway, outlines its role in autoimmunity, and explains the rationale/pre-clinical evidence for targeting JAK–STAT signaling. The safety and clinical efficacy of the Jakinibs are reviewed, starting with the FDA-approved Jakinib tofacitinib, and continuing on to next-generation Jakinibs.

Higher levels of both specific (51)Cr release and IFN were obtained in the assays containing PK-15-TGE cells. Co-cultivation of PBL from newborn piglets with PK-15-TGE cells yielded similar levels of IFN to those produced by co-cultivation of adult PBL and PK-15-TGE cells, but lower levels of IFN were produced by co-cultivation with uninfected PK-15 cells.

Zoonoses represent an additional threat to public health because the natural reservoirs are often animals, particularly wildlife, thus eluding control efforts such as quarantine, vaccination and social distancing. As there are limited resources available, it is necessary to prioritize diseases in order to allocate resources to those posing the greatest public health threat. Many studies have attempted to prioritize zoonoses, but challenges exist. This study uses a quantitative approach, conjoint analysis (CA), to overcome some limitations of traditional disease prioritization exercises. We used CA to conduct a zoonoses prioritization study involving a range of human and animal health professionals across North America; these included epidemiologists, public health practitioners, research scientists, physicians, veterinarians, laboratory technicians and nurses. A total of 699 human health professionals (HHP) and 585 animal health professionals (AHP) participated in this study. We used CA to prioritize 62 zoonotic diseases using 21 criteria. Our findings suggest CA can be used to produce reasonable criteria scores for disease prioritization. The fitted models were satisfactory for both groups with a slightly better fit for AHP compared to HHP (84.4% certainty fit versus 83.6%). Human‐related criteria were more influential for HHP in their decision to prioritize zoonoses, while animal‐related criteria were more influential for AHP resulting in different disease priority lists. While the differences were not statistically significant, a difference of one or two ranks could be considered important for some individuals. A potential solution to address the varying opinions is discussed. The scientific framework for disease prioritization presented can be revised on a regular basis by updating disease criteria to reflect diseases as they evolve over time; such a framework is of value allowing diseases of highest impact to be identified routinely for resource allocation.",2015-08-14,"Ng, V.; Sargeant, J.

Failure of neuroantigen-specific immune tolerance to affect the clinical course of demyelination,10.1016/0165-5728(90)90115-4,PMC7119834,1688446,no-cc,"Intracerebral inoculation of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) into susceptible mouse strains produces a chronic demyelinating disease in which mononuclear cell-rich infiltrates in the central nervous system (CNS) are prominent. Current evidence strongly supports an immune-mediated basis for myelin breakdown, with an effector role proposed for TMEV-specific, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in which lymphokine-activated macrophages mediate bystander demyelination. The present study examined the possibility that concomitant or later-appearing neuroantigen-specific autoimmune T cell responses, such as those demonstrated in chronic-relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (R-EAE), may contribute to the demyelinating process following TMEV infection. T cell responses against intact, purified major myelin proteins (myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP), and against altered myelin constituents were readily demonstrable in SJL/J mice with R-EAE, but were not detectable in SJL/J mice with TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. TMEV-infected mice also did not display T cell responses against the peptide fragments of MBP(91–104) and PLP(139–151) recently shown to be encephalitogenic in SJL/J mice. In addition, induction of neuroantigen-specific tolerance to a heterogeneous mixture of CNS antigens, via the i.v. injection of syngeneic SJL/J splenocytes covalently coupled with mouse spinal cord homogenate, resulted in significant suppression of clinical and histologic signs of R-EAE and the accompanying MBP- and PLP-specific DTH responses. In contrast, neuroantigen-specific tolerance failed to alter the development of clinical and histologic signs of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease or the accompanying virus-specific DTH and humoral immune responses. These findings demonstrate that TMEV-induced demyelinating disease can occur in the apparent absence of neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses.

Theory predicts that as a disease transmission system undergoes a transition from stability at the disease-free equilibrium to sustained transmission, it will exhibit characteristic behaviours known as critical slowing down, referring to the speed at which fluctuations in the number of cases are dampened, for instance the extinction of a local transmission chain after infection from an imported case. These phenomena include increases in several summary statistics, including lag-1 autocorrelation, variance and the first difference of variance. Here, we report the first empirical test of this prediction during the resurgence of malaria in Kericho, Kenya. For 10 summary statistics, we measured the approach to criticality in a rolling window to quantify the size of effect and directions. Nine of the statistics increased as predicted and variance, the first difference of variance, autocovariance, lag-1 autocorrelation and decay time returned early warning signals of critical slowing down based on permutation tests. These results show that time series of disease incidence collected through ordinary surveillance activities may exhibit characteristic signatures prior to an outbreak, a phenomenon that may be quite general among infectious disease systems.",2020-03-18,"Harris, Mallory J.; Hay, Simon I.; Drake, John M.",Biol Lett,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d62a5bd6b927e5eac13751a66df4458f3fdc4c13.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115183.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115183/,

Data suggest that both the extracellular matrix and the microbiota represent microenvironments that contribute to the onset and progression of tumours.

During the last 20 yr, infectious diseases have indeed made a staggering comeback for a variety of reasons, including resistance against existing antibiotics. As a consequence, several alternatives to antibiotics are currently being considered or reconsidered. Passive immunization (i.e., the administration of more or less pathogen-specific antibodies to the patient) prior to or after exposure to the disease-causing agent is one of those alternative strategies that was almost entirely abandoned with the introduction of chemical antibiotics but that is now gaining interest again. This review will discuss the early successes and limitations of passive immunization, formerly referred to as “serum therapy,” the current use of antibody administration for prophylaxis or treatment of infectious diseases in agriculture, and, finally, recent developments in the field of antibody engineering and “molecular farming of antibodies in various expression systems.

While multiple methods having been created to characterize this variation through the identification of groups of species that tend to co‐occur, most of these methods unfortunately are not able to represent gradual variation in species composition. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is a mixed‐membership method that can represent gradual changes in community structure by delineating overlapping groups of species, but its use has been limited because it requires abundance data and requires users to a priori set the number of groups. We substantially extend LDA to accommodate widely available presence/absence data and to simultaneously determine the optimal number of groups. Using simulated data, we show that this model is able to accurately determine the true number of groups, estimate the underlying parameters, and fit with the data. We illustrate this method with data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). Overall, our model identified 18 main bird groups, revealing striking spatial patterns for each group, many of which were closely associated with temperature and precipitation gradients. Furthermore, by comparing the estimated proportion of each group for two time periods (1997–2002 and 2010–2015), our results indicate that nine (of 18) breeding bird groups exhibited an expansion northward and contraction southward of their ranges, revealing subtle but important community‐level biodiversity changes at a continental scale that are consistent with those expected under climate change.

HO exists as constitutive (HO-2, HO-3) and inducible isoforms (HO-1), the latter which responds to regulation by multiple stress-stimuli. HO-1 confers protection in vitro and in vivo against oxidative cellular stress. Although the redox active compounds that are generated from HO activity (i.e. iron, biliverdin-IXα, and bilirubin-IXα) potentially modulate oxidative stress resistance, increasing evidence points to cytoprotective roles for CO. Though not reactive, CO regulates vascular processes such as vessel tone, smooth muscle proliferation, and platelet aggregation, and possibly functions as a neurotransmitter. The latter effects of CO depend on the activation of guanylate cyclase activity by direct binding to the heme moiety of the enzyme, stimulating the production of cyclic 3′:5′-guanosine monophosphate. CO potentially interacts with other intracellular hemoprotein targets, though little is known about the functional significance of such interactions. Recent progress indicates that CO exerts novel anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects dependent on the modulation of the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling pathway.

Bacterial respiratory infections are uncommon in athletes. Undiagnosed or inappropriately treated asthma and/or allergy are common findings in clinical assessments of elite athletes experiencing recurrent URS. High‐performance athletes with recurrent episodes of URS should undergo a thorough clinical assessment to exclude underlying treatable conditions of respiratory inflammation. Identifying athletes at risk of recurrent URS is important in order to prescribe preventative clinical, training and lifestyle strategies. Monitoring secretion rates and falling concentrations of salivary IgA can identify athletes at risk of URS.

Hundreds of different components in a TCM prescription can cure the diseases or relieve the patients by modulating the network of potential therapeutic targets. Although there is no doubt of the efficacy, it is difficult to elucidate convincing underlying mechanism of TCM due to its complex composition and unclear pharmacology. Without thorough investigation of its potential targets and side effects, TCM is not able to generate large-scale medicinal benefits, especially in the days when scientific reductionism and quantification are dominant. The use of ligand-protein networks has been gaining significant value in the history of drug discovery while its application in TCM is still in its early stage. This article firstly surveys TCM databases for virtual screening that have been greatly expanded in size and data diversity in recent years.

Furthermore, applications of successful in silico target identification attempts are discussed in details along with experiments in exploring the ligand-protein networks of TCM.

Many, if not most, of all important zoonoses relate in some way to animals in the food production chain. Therefore, the food becomes an important vehicle for many, but not all, of these zoonotic pathogens. One of the major issues in food safety over the latest decennia has been the lack of cross-sectoral collaboration across the food production chain. Major food safety events have been significantly affected by the lack of collaboration between the animal health, the food control, and the human health sector. Examples range from BSE and E. coli outbreaks over dioxin crises to intentional melamine contamination. One Health formulates clearly both the need for and the benefit of cross-sectoral collaboration. In this chapter, we will focus on the human health risk related to zoonotic microorganisms present both in food animals and food from these animals, and typically transmitted to humans through food. We focus on these issues because they are very important in relation to the human disease burden, but also because this is the area where some experience of cross-sectoral collaboration already exist. Food related zoonoses can be separated in three major classes: parasites, bacteria, and viruses. While parasites often relate to very specific animal hosts and contribute significantly to the human disease burden, virus have often been related to major, well-published global outbreaks, e.g. SARS and avian- and swine-influenza. The bacterial zoonoses on the other hand often result in sporadic, but very wide-spread disease cases, resulting in a major disease burden in all countries, e.g. Salmonella and Campylobacter. Next to these traditional zoonotic problems, the use of antimicrobials in (food) animals has also caused the emergence of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) zoonotic bacteria. It is important to realize the difference in the nature of disease epidemiology, as well as, in society’s reaction to these diseases in different socio-economic settings. Some diseases have global epidemic—or pandemic—potential, resulting in dramatic action from international organizations and national agricultural—and health authorities in most countries, for instance as was the case with avian influenza.

They would aim to protect globally against pandemic influenza viruses that have not yet evolved. Thus they differ from seasonal vaccines to influenza virus, which are updated annually in spring to incorporate the latest circulating viruses, and are then produced and delivered before the peak influenza season starts in late fall and winter. The efficacy of seasonal vaccines is linked to their ability to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies, which provide subtype-specific protection against influenza A viruses. If pandemic vaccines were designed to resemble current vaccines in terms of composition and mode of action, they would have to be developed, tested, and mass-produced after the onset of a pandemic, once the causative virus had been identified. The logistic problems of generating a pandemic vaccine from scratch, conducting preclinical testing, and producing billions of doses within a few months for global distribution are enormous and may well be insurmountable.

Private individuals routinely mitigate infectious disease risks through the adoption of a range of precautions, from vaccination to changes in their contact with others. Such precautions have epidemiological consequences. Private disease-risk mitigation generally reduces both peak prevalence of symptomatic infection and the number of people who fall ill. At the same time, however, it can prolong an epidemic. A reduction in prevalence is socially beneficial. Prolongation of an epidemic is not. We find that for a large class of infectious diseases, private risk mitigation is socially suboptimal—either too low or too high. The social optimum requires either more or less private mitigation. Since private mitigation effort depends on the cost of mitigation and the cost of illness, interventions that change either of these costs may be used to alter mitigation decisions. We model the potential for instruments that affect the cost of illness to yield net social benefits. We find that where a disease is not very infectious or the duration of illness is short, it may be socially optimal to promote private mitigation effort by increasing the cost of illness. By contrast, where a disease is highly infectious or long lasting, it may be optimal to discourage private mitigation by reducing the cost of disease. Society would prefer a shorter, more intense, epidemic to a longer, less intense epidemic. There is, however, a region in parameter space where the relationship is more complicated. For moderately infectious diseases with medium infectious periods, the social optimum depends on interactions between prevalence and duration.

The previous studies have provided different theoretical predictions of the epidemic threshold for the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, but the numerical verification of these theoretical predictions is still lacking. Considering that the large fluctuation of the outbreak size occurs near the epidemic threshold, we propose a novel numerical identification method of SIR epidemic threshold by analyzing the peak of the epidemic variability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that the variability measure can successfully give the numerical threshold for the SIR model. The heterogeneous mean-field prediction agrees very well with the numerical threshold, except the case that the networks are disassortative, in which the quenched mean-field prediction is relatively close to the numerical threshold. Moreover, the numerical method presented is also suitable for the susceptible-infected-susceptible model.

The main cortical and subcortical brain areas of 50 polydrug deaths were analyzed as compared with controls. In the brains of drug abusers, a significant neuronal loss was present. Interestingly, the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes was reduced. the numerical density of perivascular and parenchymal microglia was increased in the white matter and in most subcortical regions. In the white matter there were widespread β-amyloid precursor protein deposits. Furthermore, there was a prominent vascular hyalinosis, endothelial cell proliferation, and a loss of immunoreactivity for collagen type IV within the vascular basal lamina. The neuronal loss seems to be the result of a direct impairment of nerve cells and, indirectly, to a damage of astrocytes, axons, and the microvasculature. The reduction of GFAP-positive astrocytes is also indicative of a drug-induced damage. The axonal injury suggests a toxic-metabolic drug effect, whereas the concomitant activation of microglia is indicative of a long-standing progressive process.

Such defects encompass a wide spectrum of clinical disease, presenting in the neonatal period or infancy with recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, liver dysfunction, hyperammonaemia and often cardiac dysfunction. In older children, adolescence or adults there is often exercise intolerance with episodic myalgia or rhabdomyolysis in association with prolonged aerobic exercise or other exacerbating factors. Some disorders are particularly associated with toxic metabolites that may contribute to encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, axonopathy and pigmentary retinopathy. The phenotypic diversity encountered in defects of fat oxidation is partly explained by genotype/phenotype correlation and certain identifiable environmental factors but there remain many unresolved questions regarding the complex interaction of genetic, epigenetic and environmental influences that dictate phenotypic expression.

Neonatal mortality continues to remain high with little improvement over the years in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. This region shows the least progress in reducing neonatal mortality and continues to be a significant public health issue. In this study setting, the causes and predictors of neonatal death in the neonatal intensive care units are not well documented. Hence, this study aimed to determine the causes and predictors of neonatal mortality among infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units in eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based in prospective follow-up study was conducted among neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals of eastern Ethiopia from November 1 to December 30, 2018. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and a follow-up checklist. The main outcomes and causes of death were set by pediatricians and medical residents. EpiData 3.1 and Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 25 software were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of facility-based neonatal mortality. RESULTS: The proportion of facility-based neonatal mortality was 20% (95% CI:16.7–23.8%). The causes of death were complications of preterm birth (28.58%), birth asphyxia (22.45%), neonatal infection (18.36%), meconium aspiration syndrome (9.18%), respiratory distress syndrome (7.14%), and congenital malformation (4.08%). Low birth weight, preterm births, length of stay of the neonatal intensive care unit, low 5 min APGAR score, hyperthermia, and initiation of feeding were predictors of neonatal death among infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals in eastern Ethiopia. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of facility-based neonatal deaths was unacceptably high. The main causes of death were preventable and treatable. Hence, improving the timing and quality of antenatal care is essential for early detection, anticipating high-risk newborns, and timely interventions. Furthermore, early initiation of feeding and better referral linkage to tertiary health facilities could lead to a reduction in neonatal death in this setting.",2020-04-14,"Desalew, Assefa; Sintayehu, Yitagesu; Teferi, Nardos; Amare, Firehiwot; Geda, Bifitu; Worku, Teshager; Abera, Kebebush; Asefaw, Abiyot",BMC Pediatr,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/88cbf50f4738413bc7aadd62fc0154aa869f8c74.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7155275.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155275/,

This guideline can only be used as a blueprint in combination with other specific guidelines, especially those concerned with EC recommendations during production and quality control for various biotech products. A potential risk associated with the production and use of biological products is viral contamination. This contamination may be present in the source material, eg. human blood, human or animal tissues, cell banks, or introduced in the manufacturing process through the use of animal sera (eg. foetal calf serum or trypsin) in cell culture supernatant. The objectives of validation are to establish — ideally both qualitatively as well as quantitatively — the overall level of virus clearance. Evidence of viral clearance must be obtained in all stages of purification and adequate viral removal and/or inactivation must be proven. The method used when validating viral removal and /or inactivation is by challenging the system through the deliberate addition (“spiking”) of significant amounts of virus into the crude material to be purified and to different fractions obtained during the various purification stages. Removal or inactivation of the virus during the subsequent stages of purification and /or inactivation is thereafter determined. Such a quality system is by no means a simple one: it is estimated that in some production lines around 600 Standard Operating Procedures are necessary to guarantee the quality and the safety of the desired biotechnological product. Small companies will probably not be able to perform all procedures needed for obtaining the desired quality of the product. Then, external laboratories may take over a part of the Part II development requirements, which may not be representative for the total of internal Quality Assurance.

Bacteriophages (or phages) are often used to model the behavior of pathogenic human viruses as they are similar in size, structure and behavior. This study investigated the removal of phages MS‐2 (25 nm) and T4 (200 nm) in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) with a membrane pore size of 0.4 µm. RESULTS: The membrane reactor without biomass was assessed and its log removal was 0.7 ± 0.4 log for the MS‐2 phage, and 2.3 ± 0.2 log for the T4. When anaerobic biomass was added to the reactor the log removal for both phages increased, and this was thought to be due to a complex relationship with the biofilm on the membrane. CONCLUSIONS: Overall MS‐2 rejections ranged from 1.75 up to 5.5 log, with the highest rejections observed at the highest sparging rates after extensive fouling had occurred.

DESIGN: Single-center study with 19 patients, followed by a multicenter randomized comparison of surfactant with a standardized treatment algorithm. Primary endpoint PaO(2)/FIO(2) at 48 h, secondary endpoints: PaO(2)/FIO(2) at 2, 4, 12, and 24 h, survival, survival without rescue, days on ventilator, subgroups analyzed by analysis of variance to identify patients who might benefit from surfactant SETTING: Multicenter study in 19 reference centers for ARDS. PATIENTS: Children after the 44th postconceptional week and under 14 years old, admitted for at least 4 h, ventilated for 12–120 h, and without heart failure or chronic lung disease. In the multicenter study 35 patients were recruited; 20 were randomized to the surfactant group and 15 to the nonsurfactant group. Decreasing recruitment of patients led to a preliminary end of this study. INTERVENTIONS: Administration of 100 mg/kg bovine surfactant intratracheally under continuous ventilation and PEEP, as soon as the PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio dropped to less than 100 for 2 h (in the pilot study increments of 50 mg/kg as long as the PaO(2)/FIO(2) did not increase by 20%). A second equivalent dose within 48 h was permitted. RESULTS: In the pilot study the PaO(2)/FIO(2) increased by a mean of 100 at 48 h (n=19). A higher PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was observed in the surfactant group 2 h after the first dose (58 from baseline vs. 9), at 48 h there was a trend towards a higher ratio (38 from baseline vs. 22). The rate of rescue therapy was significantly lower in the surfactant group. Outcome criteria were not affected by a second surfactant dose (n=11). A significant difference in PaO(2)/FIO(2) in favor of surfactant at 48 h was found in the subgroup with an initial PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio higher than 65 and in patients without pneumonia.

In this review, an attempt has been made to discuss the available knowledge within the framework of a problem-oriented approach, which appears to provide a more clinically useful insight than a drug-centred review. Following a brief discussion of the scanty data and the most interesting models to which reference can be made from a pharmacokinetic point of view (the burn patient being taken as an example), the review concentrates on the main general intervention strategies in intensive care patients. These are based mainly on non-pharmacological measures (correction of fluid and electrolyte balance, total parenteral nutrition, enterai nutrition, oxygenation and ventilatory management) and are discussed with respect to the specific challenge they present in various clinical conditions and organ failure situations. In addition, 4 major selected clinical conditions where general management criteria and careful use of prophylactic and therapeutic drug treatments must interact to cope with the variety of presentations and problems are reviewed. These include: acute cerebral damage; anti-infective prophylaxis and therapy; cardiovascular emergencies; and problems of haemostasis. Each problem is analysed in such a way as to frame the pharmacological intervention in its broader context of the underlying (established or hypothesised) pathophysiology, with special attention being paid to those methodological issues which allow an appreciation of the degree of reliability of the data and the recommendations which appear to be practiced (often haphazardly) in intensive care units. The thorough review of the published literature provided (up to mid-1986) clearly shows that in this field the quality of randomised controlled and epidemiological studies is rather unsatisfactory. It would be highly beneficial to research and to clinical care if larger multicentric protocols and prospective epidemiological comparative investigations could be carried out to investigate more timely and adequately the variables which determine drug action, and the final outcome in the many subgroups of patients which must be considered in a proper stratification of intensive care unit populations.",2012-10-23,"Farina, Maria Luisa; Bonati, Maurizio; Iapichino, Gaetano; Pesenti, Antonio; Procaccio, Francesco; Boselli, Luigi; Langer, Martin; Graziina, Augusta; Tognoni, Gianni",Drugs,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0231e91dbdf6a9e93b6816f535331328e54982ed.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101565/,

Here, we present a detailed analysis of a previously proposed model that combines heterogeneity in the individuals with adaptive rewiring of the network structure in response to a disease. We show that in this model, qualitative changes in the dynamics occur in two phase transitions. In a macroscopic description, one of these corresponds to a local bifurcation, whereas the other one corresponds to a non-local heteroclinic bifurcation. This model thus provides a rare example of a system where a phase transition is caused by a non-local bifurcation, while both micro- and macro-level dynamics are accessible to mathematical analysis. The bifurcation points mark the onset of a behaviour that we call network inoculation. In the respective parameter region, exposure of the system to a pathogen will lead to an outbreak that collapses but leaves the network in a configuration where the disease cannot reinvade, despite every agent returning to the susceptible class.

Here we classify selected European hydrophytes into ‘attribute groups’ based on the possession of homogenous sets of characteristics, and explore the correspondence between these attribute groups, or individual attributes, and habitat use. 2.. Non‐hierarchical clustering was used to assign 120 species to twenty groups based on a matrix of categorical scores for literature‐ and field‐derived information covering seventeen intrinsic morphological and life‐history traits. Subdivision of some of these traits produced a total of 58 attributes (i.e. modalities). The robustness of this classification was confirmed by a high rate of reclassification (92%) under multiple discriminant analysis (MDA). The phylogenetic contribution was explored using ordination methods with taxonomy at family level acting as a covariable. 3.. Our approach differed from earlier classifications based on growth or life form because we regarded growth form plasticity as a property of the species and its range of growing conditions, rather than of each individual population, and we considered additional (e.g. regenerative) traits. However, some conventional life form groups were preserved (i.e. utricularids, isoetids, hydrocharids and lemnids). 4.. Some parallels existed with established theory on terrestrial plant growth strategies, but we used strictly intrinsic attributes relevant specifically to hydrophytes and our groups could not be decomposed into three or four primary strategies. Only finer levels of partitioning appear to be of fundamental and applied ecological relevance in hydrophytes. 5.. A principal components analysis ordination based on 26 attributes related to physical habitat utilization separated species and their attribute groups along axes relating to: (a) flow, substratum grade and organic matter content, scour frequency, and sedimentation; and (b) depth, water level stability and biotic disturbance. A MDA applied to species ordination scores indicated only a modest overall correspondence between attribute groups and habitat use (54% correct reclassification). Poor reclassification was the result of intergroup overlap (indicating alternative sets of attributes for a given habitat) or high intragroup variance in habitat utilization (indicating commonality of attributes between different habitats). These results are interpreted in terms of trade‐offs between resistance and resilience traits, ‘functional plasticity’ in traits, phylogenetic dependence in some groups and methodological constraints. The predictive potential of hydrophyte groups and their limitations are discussed. 6.. Redundancy analysis revealed a highly significant correlation between traits and habitat use (P < 0.01). Our attribute matrix explained 72% of variation in physical habitat use with eight attributes (i.e. turions, anchored emergent leaves, high or low body flexibility, high root:shoot biomass ratio, free‐floating surface or free‐floating submerged growth form, and annual life history) explaining half of this variation. 7.. Most attributes were mapped in accordance with habitat template predictions, although tests were confounded by the underlying correlation between spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The main features were: (a) a trade‐off between resistance‐type traits (related to stream lining, flexibility and anchorage) in more spatially heterogenous riverine and littoral zone habitats, and resilience type traits (i.e. turions, very small body size and free‐floating growth forms) in spatially simple, rarely disturbed habitats, such as backwaters and canals; and (b) a shift from high investment competitive traits with a low reproductive output in deep stable habitats to classically ruderal and desiccation resistance traits in shallow fluctuating habitats.",2008-09-15,"Willby, Nigel J.; Abernethy, Vicky J.; Demars, Benoît O.

Thirty-five patients enrolled in this multi-institutional phase I/II trial received up to eight arterial infusions of up to 2 × 10(12) viral particles. Hepatic toxicity was the primary dose-limiting toxicity observed in preclinical models. However, nearly 200 infusions of this adenoviral vector were administered directly into the hepatic artery without significant toxicity. Therefore, we undertook this analysis to determine the impact of repeated adenoviral exposure on hepatic function. Seventeen patients were treated at our institution, providing a detailed data set on the changes in hepatic function following repeated exposure to adenovirus. No changes in hepatic function occurred with the first treatment of Onyx-015 among these patients. Transient increases in transaminase levels occurred in one patient starting with the second infusion and transient increases in bilirubin was observed in two patients starting with the fifth treatment. These changes occurred too early to be explained by viral-mediated lysis of hepatocytes. In addition, viremia was observed starting 3–5 days after the viral infusion in half of the patient, but was not associated with hepatic toxicity. To further understand the basis for the minimal hepatic toxicity of adenoviral vectors, we evaluated the replication of adenovirus in primary hepatocytes and tumor cells in culture and the expression of the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR) in normal liver and colon cancer metastatic to the liver. We found that adenovirus replicates poorly in primary hepatocytes but replicates efficiently in tumors including tumors derived from hepatocytes. In addition, we found that CAR is localized at junctions between hepatocytes and is inaccessible to hepatic blood flow. CAR is not expressed on tumor vasculature but is expressed on tumor cells. Spatial restriction of CAR to the intercellular space in normal liver and diminished replication of adenovirus in hepatocytes may explain the minimal toxicity observed following repeated hepatic artery infusions with Onyx-015.",2006-12-01,"Au, T; Thorne, S; Korn, W M; Sze, D; Kirn, D; Reid, T R",Cancer Gene Ther,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091580.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091580/,

Previous data from this laboratory had shown that the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) enhances IFN-γ-mediated class II antigen expression on astrocytes. We have now investigated the effect of IFN-γ and TNF-α on class II MHC mRNA expression in astrocytes using Northern blot analysis. Astrocytes do not constitutively express mRNA for class II MHC. Kinetic analysis of class II MHC mRNA expression in IFN-γ-treated cells demonstrated an 8 h time lag, which was followed by an increase over the next 16 h. Optimal expression of class II mRNA was detected after a 24 h incubation with IFN-γ. This level of expression was further enhanced by the simultaneous addition of IFN-γ and TNF-α to the astrocytes, while TNF-α alone had no effect on class II mRNA expression. TNF-α does not act by increasing the stability of IFN-γ-induced class II mRNA, indicating its action is not at that specific level of post-transcriptional control. Furthermore, astrocyte class II mRNA expression was inhibited when cycloheximide (CHX) was added together with IFN-γ or IFN-γ/TNF-α, and when CHX was added up to 4 h after treatment with IFN-γ or IFN-γ/TNF-α. These results indicate that astrocyte class II mRNA expression is mediated by newly synthesized proteins induced by IFN-γ and/or IFN-γ/TNF-α. The expression of class II antigens on astrocytes, and cytokine modulation of their expression, may be important in the initiation and perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.",2002-11-13,"Vidovic, Maria; Sparacio, Shaun M.; Elovitz, Michal; Benveniste, Etty N.",J Neuroimmunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b3ba2f2b4e4247cd2cb7d5f413fa9ea3835bd6b4.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119667/,

By contrast, CTL specific for influenza virus (FLU) and mumps virus is normal. It is uncertain if reduced CTL is limited to MV in MS patients, or if reduced CTL may be found to other viruses as well. Since MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules, while FLU-specific and mumps-specific CTL have large HLA class I-restricted components, reduced MV-specific CTL may reflect a broader reduction in HLA class II-restricted CTL in patients with MS. To examine this question we studied the generation of CTL specific for herpes simplex virus type I (HSV). HSV-specific CTL, like MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules. We found that patients with MS had reduced generation of CTL to both MV and HSV. Most, but not all patients who had reduced generation of CTL to one virus also had a similar impairment with respect to the second virus. Some patients, however, had a reduction in the generation of CTL only to MV or to HSV. These findings extend our earlier observations regarding reduced MV-specific CTL in patients with MS to a second HLA class II-restricted virus, HSV.

METHODS: We conducted a survey of 400 HCWs working in eight hospitals in Beijing by face to face interview using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: We found that 280/400 (70.0%) of HCWs were compliant with mask-wearing while in contact with patients. Respiratory infection occurred in 238/400 (59.5%) subjects from November, 2007 through February, 2008. Respiratory infection was higher among females (odds ratio [OR], 2.00 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.16-3.49]) and staff working in larger hospitals (OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.09-2.72]), but was lower among subjects with seasonal influenza vaccination (OR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.28-0.76]), wearing medical masks (reference: cotton-yarn; OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.39-0.91]) or with good mask-wearing adherence (OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.37-0.98]). The risk of respiratory infection of HCWs working in low risk areas was similar to that of HCWs in high risk area. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that female HCWs and staffs working in larger hospitals are the focus of prevention and control of respiratory infection in Beijing hospitals.

Although its etiology is as yet unknown current evidence suggests that tissue damage is mediated by autoimmune T cells. The examination of an experimental animal model for MS, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), has demonstrated that myelin basic protein (MBP)- or proteolipid protein (PLP)-specific T cells mediate the destruction of CNS myelin. In recent years, elegant studies in EAE have shown that encephalitogenic T cells recognize short peptides of MBP or PLP in the context of MHC/HLA-class II molecules, express a restricted number of T cell receptor (TCR) molecules and secrete interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-a/β. Understanding the pathogenetic steps in lesion development at the molecular level led to highly specific immunotherapies for EAE targeting each individual molecule. It has been the hope of many investigators that immunological events resembling those in EAE can be found in patients with MS and that the specific immunotherapies effective in EAE could also be applied to MS. However, to date, the evidence for a unique immunological abnormality in MS is notstrong. Although MBP- and PLP-specific T cells with properties similar to those that are encephalitogenic in animals can be isolated from patients, they are not specific for MS and occur with similar frequency in controls. In addition, the variability in specificity and TCR usage has raised questions regarding the relevance of these cells in patients. The importance of the T cell responses to myelin antigens in MS may not be established until the effects of abrogating their activity through specific therapies targeting the trimolecular complex (TMC) have been demonstrated. Consequently, attention has begun to focus on modifying the biology of the MS lesion rather than targeting the initiating event at the level of the TMC, and the success of this approach is reflected by the effect of interferon-β on lesion development in MS. The recent approval for the use of interferon-β for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS has raised great interest in examining novel strategies for immunotherapies in MS. The basic concepts as well as the current candidates for such new immunotherapies will be outlined in this short review.",1996,"Martin, Roland; McFarland, Henry",Springer Semin Immunopathol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2b262883a91d37abb9f468c330d7d9a10ee69982.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087544/,

Traditionally, vaccines have been administered by needle injection. Topical immunization through the intact skin with either protein- or DNA-based vaccines has attracted much attention recently. We sought to enhance the immune responses induced by DNA-based vaccines after topical application by developing novel ethanol-in-fluorocarbon (E/F) microemulsion systems to aid in the delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA). Methods. Ten different fluorosurfactants were selected or synthesized and screened by pseudo-phase-diagram construction for their ability to form E/F microemulsions. Plasmid DNA was successfully incorporated into E/F microemulsions using several different fluorosurfactants and perfluorooctyl bromide as the continuous fluorocarbon phase. For several reasons, Zonyl® FSN-100 (an ethoxylated nonionic fluorosurfactant) was selected for further studies. In vivo studies were performed in mice to assess pDNA expression in skin and immunologic responses after topical application of this system using a luciferase-encoding plasmid (CMV-luciferase) and a CMV-β-galactosidase-encoding plasmid, respectively. Results. Plasmid DNA incorporated into E/F microemulsion using FSN-100 as the surfactant was found to be stable. After topical application of this E/F microemulsion system, significant enhancements in luciferase expression and antibody and T-helper type-1 biased immune responses were observed relative to those of “naked” pDNA in saline or ethanol. For example, with the E/F microemulsion system, the specific serum IgG and IgA titers were increased by 45-fold and over 1000-fold, respectively. Conclusion.

Mean airway pressure was raised from a mean (SD) 12.5 (2.0) during CMV to 18.9 (2.7) cmH(2)O during HFOVi (P < 0.05), then decreased to 11.1(1.3) at HFOVe (P < 0.05). Mean FiO(2) was reduced from 0.68 (0.18) (CMV) to 0.59 (0.14) (HFOVi) then to 0.29 (0.06) (P < 0.05) at HFOVe and mean peak to peak pressure from 44.9 (12.4) cmH(2)O (HFOVi) to 21.1 (7.7) P < 0.05 (HFOVe) while mean (SD) PaCO(2) showed a trend to decrease from 72 (22) (CMV) to 47 (8) mmHg (HFVOe) and mean infants respiratory rate a trend to increase from 20 (11) (HFOVi) to 34 (14) (HFOVe) breaths/min. With usual doses of sedatives and opiates, no infant was paralysed and all were extubated to CPAP or supplemental oxygen after a mean of 120 h. CONCLUSION: RSV induced respiratory failure with hypercapnia can be managed with HFOV using high mean airway pressure and large pressure swings while preserving spontaneous breathing.",2008-05-24,"Berner, Michel E.; Hanquinet, Sylviane; Rimensberger, Peter C.",Intensive Care Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/cc4f5ea4f3488858e3d10111685e01d627ed8d96.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095463.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095463/,

For large genomes, pooled library screening followed by Y2H pairwise retests may be more efficient in terms of time and resources, but multiple sampling is necessary to ensure comprehensive screening.

Whereas many viruses show high mutation rates enabling them to develop escape mutants, mutations of their cellular virus receptors are far less likely. We report on antiviral efficacies of CAR gene silencing by short hairpin (sh)RNAs in the cardiac-derived HL-1 cell line and in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (PNCMs). Treatment with shRNA vectors mediating RNA interference against the CAR resulted in almost complete silencing of receptor expression both in HL-1 cells and PNCMs. Whereas CAR was silenced in HL-1 cells as early as 24 h after vector treatment, its downregulation in PNCMs did not become significant before day 6. CAR knockout resulted in inhibition of CoxB3 infections by up to 97% in HL-1 cells and up to 90% in PNCMs. Adenovirus was inhibited by only 75% in HL-1 cells, but up to 92% in PNCMs. We conclude that CAR knockout by shRNA vectors is efficient against CoxB3 and adenovirus in primary cardiac cells, but the efficacy of this approach in vivo may be influenced by cell type-specific silencing kinetics in different tissues.",2007-03-22,"Fechner, H; Pinkert, S; Wang, X; Sipo, I; Suckau, L; Kurreck, J; Dörner, A; Sollerbrant, K; Zeichhardt, H; Grunert, H-P; Vetter, R; Schultheiss, H-P; Poller, W",Gene Ther,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/aa85f884fe87ec039fa883a30e962acd46d882da.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091640.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091640/,

In order to investigate the origin and function of this region and its occurrence in nature, the cDNA sequences of the 3' non-coding regions of three additional strains of IBV, Gray, Arkansas (Ark) 99 and Holland (Holl) 52, were determined and compared to the sequences of the Beaudette, KB8523 and Mass41 strains. Not only was this U-rich sequence absent from the 3' non-coding region of the Mass41 strain, it was also highly variable, especially in comparison to the highly conserved 3' non coding region downstream of this sequence.

Hand motions during FSC physically affect psychological state. However, it is very difficult to evaluate hand motions during personal and complex FSC. The objective of this study was to find out objective and quantitative parameters for hand motions during facial skin care (FSC). Women who enjoy and soothe during FSC (Enjoyment group (E group), n = 20) or not (non-enjoyment group (NE group), n = 19) were recruited by an advance questionnaire. The same lotion, emulsion, and cream were provided to all subjects, and they used sequentially in the same way as the women’s daily FSC. The motion of the marker on the back side of the right middle finger during FSC was tracked by a motion capture system. The heart rate variability (HRV) was also measured before and after FSC for evaluating psychological effect. RESULTS: The averaged acceleration (Avg. ACC), approximate entropy (ApEn), and power law scaling exponent (Rest γ) of the cumulative duration of slow motion from the sequential data of acceleration were evaluated. Compared to the NE group, the E group showed a lower Avg. ACC when using emulsion (p = 0.005) and cream (p = 0.007), a lower ApEn when using emulsion (p = 0.003), and a lower Rest γ (p = 0.024) when using all items, suggesting that compared to the NE group, the E group had more tender and regular motion, and sustainable slow motions, especially in the use of emulsion. In the E group, the low/high-frequency component of HRV decreased significantly after FSC, suggesting suppression of sympathetic activity (p = 0.045). NE group did not. For all subjects, ApEn and Rest γ showed significantly positive correlation with the increase in the low/high-frequency component of HRV after FSC (p < 0.01). ApEn showed significantly negative correlation with the increase in the high-frequency component of HRV after FSC (p < 0.05). Avg. ACC did not show significant correlation with them. These results suggested that the behavior of FSC influences the autonomic nerve system.

METHODS: This review describes the series of preclinical studies and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses that supported ceftazidime–avibactam dosage selection for patients with NP/VAP (2000/500 mg by 2-h intravenous infusion every 8 h, adjusted for renal function). In parallel, important considerations for antibiotic dosage selection in patients with NP are highlighted, including adequate drug penetration into the lungs, the suitability of murine-derived plasma PK/PD targets, evaluation of MIC distributions against clinical bacterial isolates from patients with NP, and consideration of PK in patients with NP, who are often critically ill. These analyses also supported the European approval of ceftazidime–avibactam for adults with HAP, including VAP, before the completion of REPROVE. CONCLUSIONS: This work serves as a successful practical example of dosage design for a new antibacterial drug therapy in the indication of NP, including VAP, where previous drug therapies have failed, possibly as a result of evaluation of too few variables, thereby limiting the accuracy of pharmacodynamic predictions.

It, however, generates additional hemodynamic indices that need to be evaluated. Our objective was to investigate the performance of a multiparametric predictive score based on a combination of several parameters generated by the PRAM monitor to predict fluid responsiveness. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a prospective observational study from April 2016 to December 2017 in two French teaching hospitals. We included critically ill patients who were monitored by esophageal Doppler monitoring and an invasive arterial line, and received a 250–500 mL crystalloid fluid challenge. The main outcome measure was the predictive score discrimination evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. RESULTS: The three baseline PRAM-derived parameters associated with fluid responsiveness in univariate analysis were pulse pressure variation, cardiac cycle efficiency, and arterial elastance (P < 0.01, P = 0.03, and P < 0.01, respectively). The median [interquartile range] predictive score, calculated after discretization of these parameters according to their optimal threshold value was 3 [2–3] in fluid responders and 1 [1–2] in fluid non-responders, respectively (P < 0.001). The area under the curve of the predictive score was 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.662 to 0.909; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A multiparametric score combining three parameters generated by the PRAM monitor can predict fluid responsiveness with good positive and negative predictive values in intensive care unit patients.

In real societies, it is expected that these two processes depend on and affect each other. However, little is known about the effects of opinion dynamics over disease dynamics and vice versa, since most studies treat them separately. In this work we study the dynamics of the voter model for opinion formation intertwined with that of the contact process for disease spreading, in a population of agents that interact via two types of connections, social and contact. These two interacting dynamics take place on two layers of networks, coupled through a fraction [Formula: see text] of links present in both networks. The probability that an agent updates its state depends on both the opinion and disease states of the interacting partner. We find that the opinion dynamics has striking consequences on the statistical properties of disease spreading. The most important is that the smooth (continuous) transition from a healthy to an endemic phase observed in the contact process, as the infection probability increases beyond a threshold, becomes abrupt (discontinuous) in the two-layer system. Therefore, disregarding the effects of social dynamics on epidemics propagation may lead to a misestimation of the real magnitude of the spreading. Also, an endemic-healthy discontinuous transition is found when the coupling [Formula: see text] overcomes a threshold value. Furthermore, we show that the disease dynamics delays the opinion consensus, leading to a consensus time that varies nonmonotonically with [Formula: see text] in a large range of the model's parameters. A mean-field approach reveals that the coupled dynamics of opinions and disease can be approximately described by the dynamics of the voter model decoupled from that of the contact process, with effective probabilities of opinion and disease transmission.",2017-05-22,"Velásquez-Rojas, Fátima; Vazquez, Federico",Phys Rev E,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3399885f297ec40a827955a4ec905b5bc843e396.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7219934.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219934/,

The mammalian fossils are fragmentary and often poorly preserved. Here, we offer an alternative method for their identification. Among the best preserved and extensive of the Eocene Arctic forests is the Strathcona Fiord Fossil Forest, which contains permineralized in situ tree stumps protruding from a prominent coal seam, but a paucity of vertebrate fossils. In 2010 and 2018, we recovered mammalian tooth fragments at the fossil forest, but they are so incomplete as to be undiagnostic by using their external morphology. We used a combination of light microscopy and SEM analysis to study the enamel microstructure of two tooth fragments from the fossil forest—NUFV2092B and 2092E. The results of our analysis indicate that NUFV2092B and 2092E have Coryphodon-enamel, which is characterized by vertical bodies that manifest as bands of nested chevrons or treelike structures visible in the tangential section under light microscopy. This enamel type is not found in other mammals known from the Arctic. Additionally, when studied under SEM, the enamel of NUFV2092B and 2092E has rounded prisms that open to one side and are surrounded by interprismatic matrix that is nearly parallel to the prisms, which also occurs in Coryphodon enamel, based on prior studies. The tooth fragments reported here, along with some poorly preserved bone fragments, thus far are the only documented vertebrate fossils from the Strathcona Fiord Fossil Forest. However, fossils of Coryphodon occur elsewhere in the Margaret Formation, so its presence at the fossil forest is not surprising.

With no consistent pattern of communication between St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (St. Jude) and its affiliated clinics, the Affiliate Program Office at St. Jude developed and implemented a standardized communication tool to facilitate patient transitions between different healthcare sites. METHODS: Each team of providers created flow diagrams to define the current state of communication when patients were transitioning between remote sites. Fishbone diagrams identified the common barriers to effective communication as a lack of consistent communication and ownership. We developed a communication tool to address these barriers, which was disseminated by secure email. We measured the percent usage of the completed hand-off tool before a patient transitioned, staff experience, and the number of errors. RESULTS: The time to send or receive the communication bundle was <10 minutes. Within 3 months of implementing the SMART bundle at 3 pilot sites, the bundle was used completely in 6 of 8 patient transitions and was associated with somewhat improved staff satisfaction. We identified no adverse events related to the communication bundle.

However, its high flammability and rapid flame spread pose dangers for certain applications. Therefore, different flame-retardant (FR) additives are incorporated into PE to increase its flame retardancy. In this review article, research papers from the past 10 years on the flame retardancy of PE systems are comprehensively reviewed and classified based on the additive sources. The FR additives are classified in well-known FR families, including phosphorous, melamine, nitrogen, inorganic hydroxides, boron, and silicon. The mechanism of fire retardance in each family is pinpointed. In addition to the efficiency of each FR in increasing the flame retardancy, its impact on the mechanical properties of the PE system is also discussed. Most of the FRs can decrease the heat release rate (HRR) of the PE products and simultaneously maintains the mechanical properties in appropriate ratios. Based on the literature, inorganic hydroxide seems to be used more in PE systems compared to other families.

METHODS: Patients spoke English, Spanish, or Mandarin Chinese, were aged 18+ years, had stage I–IIIA breast cancer, and were eligible for breast‐conserving and mastectomy surgery. Participants completed surveys about out‐of‐pocket costs and financial toxicity at 1 week, 12 weeks, and 1 year postsurgery. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety‐five of 448 eligible patients (88.2%) from the parent trial completed surveys. Excluding those reporting zero costs, crude mean ± SD out‐of‐pocket costs were $1,512 ± $2,074 at 1 week, $2,609 ± $6,369 at 12 weeks, and $3,308 ± $5,000 at 1 year postsurgery. Controlling for surgery, cancer stage, and demographics with surgeon and clinic as random effects, higher out‐of‐pocket costs were associated with higher financial toxicity 1 week and 12 weeks postsurgery (p < .001). Lower socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with lower out‐of‐pocket costs at each time point (p = .002–.013). One week postsurgery, participants with lower SES reported financial toxicity scores 1.02 points higher than participants with higher SES (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08–1.95). Black and non‐White/non‐Black participants reported financial toxicity scores 1.91 (95% CI, 0.46–3.37) and 2.55 (95% CI, 1.11–3.99) points higher than White participants. Older (65+ years) participants reported financial toxicity scores 2.58 points lower than younger (<65 years) participants (95% CI, −3.41, −1.74). Younger participants reported significantly higher financial toxicity at each time point. DISCUSSION: Younger age, non‐White race, and lower SES were associated with higher financial toxicity regardless of costs. Out‐of‐pocket costs increased over time and were positively associated with financial toxicity. Future work should reduce the impact of cancer care costs among vulnerable groups. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study was one of the first to examine out‐of‐pocket costs and financial toxicity up to 1 year after breast cancer surgery.

A large number of fungal viruses are associated with latent infections of their hosts. With the exception of the killer-immune character in the yeasts, smuts, and hypovirulence in the chestnut blight fungus, fungal properties that can specifically be related to virus infection are not well defined. Mycoviruses are not known to have natural vectors; they are transmitted in nature intracellularly by hyphal anastomosis and heterokaryosis, and are disseminated via spores. Because fungi have a potential for plasmogamy and cytoplasmic exchange during extended periods of their life cycles and because they produce many types of propagules (sexual and asexual spores), often in great profusion, mycoviruses have them accessible to highly efficient means for transmission and spread. It is no surprise, therefore, that fungal viruses are not known to have an extracellular phase to their life cycles. Although extracellular transmission of a few fungal viruses have been demonstrated, using fungal protoplasts, the lack of conventional methods for experimental transmission of these viruses have been, and remains, an obstacle to understanding their biology. The recent application of molecular biological approaches to the study of mycoviral dsRNAs and the improvements in DNA-mediated fungal transformation systems, have allowed a clearer understanding of the molecular biology of mycoviruses to emerge.

Indigenous inhabitants of the area mostly reside in remote mountainous areas and depend on wild plants for life necessities and treatment of different diseases. This paper presents first quantitative ethnobotanical study describing the popularity level of MPs in indigenous communities by using relative popularity level (RPL) and rank order of priority (ROP) indices. The data of TEMs and EB uses were collected from 200 interviewees consisting of traditional herbal practioners (110) and farmers (90) from study area using structured and semi-structured interview methodology during year 2019. It was found that illiterate peasants have more knowledge and practice of TEMs than other people. A total of 150 plant species belonging to 58 families with botanical and local names, parts used, mode of recipes preparation, administration mechanism and TEMs uses were documented in systematic manner. It was explored that highest number (7.69%) of plants of Moraceae were used in TEMs and followed by species of Asteraceae (6.29%). The ethnobotanical data was analyzed by using quantitative ethnobotanical tools viz: informant consensus factor (ICF), fidelity level (FL), relative frequency of citation (RFC), use value index (UVI), relative importance of plants (RIP), relative populatiry level (RPL) and rank order of popularity (ROP). The leaf ranked first (36.49%) and fruit 2(nd) (12.07%) being used in TEMs while prevalent use-form was decoction (29.28%), followed by tea (23.05%) and preferably taken as oral (46.66%). ICF analysis proved that diabetes, hypertension, rabies, snake sting and joint pains were the most prevalent occurring infirmities. The highest RFC (0.95) was found for Acacia modesta, followed by Boerhavia procumbens (RFC:0.87) and Berberis lycium (RFC:0.85). The relative importance of MPs was calculated by using UVI and Moringa oleifera showed highest (1.38), followed by Zanthoxylum armatum (1.25) and Withania somnifera (1.24) use-values. High UVI of plants depicts that these species are predominantly used in local health care system. The plants Phyllanthus emblica, Morus macruora, Justicia adhatoda and Melia azedarach depicted high values (1.00) of FL and RPL proving that these taxa are commonly used in indigenous medicines by local inhabitants and have better potential for drug discovery by ethnopharmacological analysis. Out of total, 26 species had more than 50% ROP index and Phyllanthus emblica and Flacourtia indica (ROP = 100) followed by Morus macruora (ROP: 97) were used to cure ‘hypertension and hyperlipidemia’ and ‘cough, chest infection’, respectively. It was found that 30% of total species were previously reported as medicinal while 70% plants were first time reported to be used in TEMs and authenticated by using of quantitative ethnobotanical tools. Ethnopharmacological potential of indigenous plants was confirmed by RIP and RPL indices which had been used to cure one or more body systems and were promulgated in the local herbal medicine system. The research provides clues to screen these plant species by using latest phytochemical and pharmacological analysis for novel drug discovery. This study will also be useful for conservation of bioculture traditional knowledge of indigenous communities and the most important is to conserve medicinal plants of the study area for future generations.",2021-01-13,"Ishtiaq, Muhammad; Maqbool, Mehwish; Ajaib, Muhammad; Ahmed, Maqsood; Hussain, Iqbal; Khanam, Humaira; Mushtaq, Waheeda; Hussain, Tanveer; Azam, Shehzad; Hayat Bhatti, Khizar; Ghani, Abdul",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f3899cdf798b7ab6296cf49f3d8f99818573aeb7.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7806180.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7806180/,

ER-degradation enhancing α-mannosidase-like (EDEM1) was proposed to extract terminally misfolded proteins from the calnexin folding cycle and target them for degradation by ERAD. Here, using mass-spectrometry and biochemical methods, we show that EDEM1 is found in auto-regulatory complexes with ERAD components. Moreover, the N-terminal disordered region of EDEM1 mediates protein–protein interaction with misfolded proteins, whilst the absence of this domain significantly impairs their degradation. We also determined that overexpression of EDEM1 can induce degradation, even when proteasomal activity is severely impaired, by promoting the formation of aggregates, which can be further degraded by autophagy. Therefore, we propose that EDEM1 maintains ER homeostasis and mediates ERAD client degradation via autophagy when either dislocation or proteasomal degradation are impaired.",2020-05-14,"Chiritoiu, Marioara; Chiritoiu, Gabriela N.; Munteanu, Cristian V.

We decomposed the tissue-level transcriptome using single-cell RNA-seq (sequencing of RNA reverse transcribed into cDNA) and found that neurogenesis and haematopoiesis dominate at both the gene and cellular levels, jointly accounting for one-third of differential gene expression and more than 40% of identified cell types. By integrating promoter sequence motifs with companion ENCODE epigenomic profiles, we identified a prominent promoter de-repression mechanism in neuronal expression clusters that was attributable to known and novel repressors. Focusing on the developing limb, single-cell RNA data identified 25 candidate cell types that included progenitor and differentiating states with computationally inferred lineage relationships. We extracted cell-type transcription factor networks and complementary sets of candidate enhancer elements by using single-cell RNA-seq to decompose integrative cis-element (IDEAS) models that were derived from whole-tissue epigenome chromatin data.

PTSD can be chronic and debilitating, and is associated with co-morbidities such as depression, substance use, and cardiometabolic disorders. One of the most important pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of PTSD and its subsequent maintenance is a dysfunctional hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. The corticotrophin-releasing hormone, cortisol, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and their respective genes are some of the mediators of PTSD’s pathophysiology. Several treatments are available, including medication and psychotherapies, although their success rate is limited. Some pharmacological therapies based on the HPA axis are currently being tested in clinical trials and changes in HPA axis biomarkers have been found to occur in response not only to pharmacological treatments, but also to psychotherapy—including the epigenetic modification of the GR gene.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 390 eyes from 256 (89.8%) intraocular RB and 29 (10.2%) extraocular RB cases diagnosed and treated between October 1998 and May 2018 at one of the largest tertiary care centers in Turkey. RESULTS: Of 351 intraocular RB eyes, 53.3% had group D/E disease at presentation. 75 (21.4%) of 351 eyes underwent primary enucleation. Of the remaining 276 eyes undergoing eye-conserving treatments, 201 (72.8%) were salvaged. Most of these eyes were treated using intravenous chemotherapy and/or focal treatments [transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) and cryotherapy] initially. EBRT was eventually required in 48 (17.4%) eyes and secondary enucleation in 75 (27.2%) eyes. At mean follow-ups of 76.7 and 39.7 months for intraocular and extraocular RB cohorts, respectively, 180 (46.2%) eyes underwent primary/secondary enucleation and exenteration. Overall, 13 cases developed metastasis and 9 died. Two patients with trilateral RB also expired. Multivariable risk factors for enucleation were the presence of vitreous seeds (p < 0.001), absence of EBRT administration (p = 0.033), 5–9 TTT applications compared with no TTT (p = 0.031), and each 1 mm increase in tumour base diameter (p < 0.001). Univariate factors predictive of metastasis were the presence of extraocular RB detected by imaging methods (p < 0.001) and extrascleral/optic nerve cut end involvement at histopathological examination (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In our series, 72.8% of the intraocular RB eyes undergoing eye-conserving treatments were saved.

Promising new biomarkers for diagnosis and immunotherapy have emerged recently. My-cobacterium is an ancient pathogen that has developed complex strategies for its persistence in the host and environment, likely based on the complexity of the network of interactions between the molecules involved in infection. Several biomarkers have received recent attention in the process of developing rapid and reliable detection techniques for tuberculosis. Among the most widely investigated antigens are CFP-10 (10-kDa culture filtrate protein), ESAT-6 (6-kDa early secretory antigenic target), Ag85A, Ag85B, CFP-7, and PPE18. Some of these antigens have been proposed as biomarkers to assess the key elements of the response to infection of both the pathogen and host. The design of novel and accurate diagnostic methods is essential for the control of tuberculosis worldwide. Presently, the diagnostic methods are based on the identification of molecules in the humoral response in infected individuals. Therefore, these tests depend on the capacity of the host to develop an immune response, which usually is heterogeneous.

Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we determine the structure of an Env segment encompassing the TMD and a large portion of the CT in bicelles. The structure reveals that the CT folds into amphipathic helices that wrap around the C-terminal end of the TMD, thereby forming a support baseplate for the rest of Env. NMR dynamics measurements provide evidences of dynamic coupling across the TMD between the ectodomain and CT.

Human γδ T cells recognize and kill transformed cells independently of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction, which is an essential feature of conventional αβ T cells. Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cells, which prevail in the peripheral blood of healthy adults, are activated by microbial or endogenous tumor-derived pyrophosphates by a mechanism dependent on butyrophilin molecules. γδ T cells expressing other T cell receptor variable genes, notably Vδ1, are more abundant in mucosal tissue. In addition to the T cell receptor, γδ T cells usually express activating natural killer (NK) receptors, such as NKp30, NKp44, or NKG2D which binds to stress-inducible surface molecules that are absent on healthy cells but are frequently expressed on malignant cells. Therefore, γδ T cells are endowed with at least two independent recognition systems to sense tumor cells and to initiate anticancer effector mechanisms, including cytokine production and cytotoxicity. In view of their HLA-independent potent antitumor activity, there has been increasing interest in translating the unique potential of γδ T cells into innovative cellular cancer immunotherapies. Here, we discuss recent developments to enhance the efficacy of γδ T cell-based immunotherapy. This includes strategies for in vivo activation and tumor-targeting of γδ T cells, the optimization of in vitro expansion protocols, and the development of gene-modified γδ T cells.

Targeting myocardial fibrosis (MF) has become a major therapeutic goal in order to prevent the occurrence of DDC. We aimed to review and summarize the current evidence about the role of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) in the development and perpetuation of MF in DCC. We conducted a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed English literature on PubMed about this subject. We found increasing preclinical evidence from studies in animal models during the last 20 years pointing out a central role of RAAS in the development of MF in DDC. Local tissue RAAS acts directly mainly through its main fibrotic component angiotensin II (ANG2) and its transducer receptor (AT1R) and downstream TGF-b pathway.

Exportin 1 (XPO1), also known as chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1), mediates nuclear export of proteins, rRNAs, snRNAs, and some mRNAs. In this study, we have identified an essential role of XPO1 in regulating Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication during primary infection of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Treatment with an XPO1 inhibitor KPT-8602 and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of XPO1 reduced KSHV lytic replication but had no effect on KSHV entry and trafficking. XPO1 inhibition induced retention of autophagy adaptor protein p62 (SQSTM1) in the nucleus, which enhanced activation of TBK1 and IRF3. As a result, nuclear accumulation of p62 increased expression of innate immune-related genes including IRF7, ISG15, IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3, leading to a reduction of KSHV lytic replication.

In this study, we investigated the effects of a natural sesquiterpene lactone, 6-O-angeloylplenolin (6-OAP), isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Centipeda minima (L.) A.Br., on neuroinflammation and the underlying mechanisms. We showed that treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused activation of BV2 and primary microglial cells and development of neuroinflammation in vitro, evidenced by increased production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and the transcriptional upregulation of COX-2 and iNOS, leading to increased production of proinflammatory factors NO and PGE(2). Moreover, LPS treatment induced oxidative stress through increasing the expression levels of NOX2 and NOX4. Pretreatment with 6-OAP (0.5−4 μM) dose-dependently attenuated LPS-induced NF-κB activation and oxidative stress, thus suppressed neuroinflammation in the cells. In a mouse model of LPS-induced neuroinflammation, 6-OAP (5−20 mg·kg(−1)·d(−1), ip, for 7 days before LPS injection) dose-dependently inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines, the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, and the expression of inflammatory enzymes in brain tissues. 6-OAP pretreatment significantly ameliorated the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the brains. 6-OAP at a high dose caused a much stronger antineuroinflammatory effect than dexamethansone (DEX). Furthermore, we demonstrated that 6-OAP pretreatment could inhibit LPS-induced neurite and synaptic loss in vitro and in vivo.

The disease has acquired endemic proportions in tropical countries where the hygienic conditions are not satisfactory while the environmental conditions favor the proliferation of parasite and its transmission, particularly through the female anopheles. It is obvious that to square up the problems, there is a need for designing and development of more effective drugs, which can combat the drug-resistant strains of the parasite. Molecular biology of the parasite and its homing into host cellular tropics provide multiple drug targets that could judiciously be considered for engineering and designing of new generation antimalarial drugs and also drug delivery systems. Though the recent reports document that against malaria parasite the vaccine could be developed, nevertheless, due to smart mutational change overs by the parasite, it is able to bypass the immune surveillance. The developed vaccine therefore failed to assure absolute protection against the malarial infection. In the conventional mode of treatment antimalarial drugs, the dose and dosage regimen that is followed at large crops up the contraindicative manifestations, and hence compromising the effective treatment. The emerging trends and new updates in contemporary biological sciences, material sciences, and drug delivery domain have enabled us with the availability of a multitude of mode and modules which could plunge upon the nanotechnology in particular to treat this challenging infection.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of national datasets with application of standard UK costings. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: All people who died in Scotland in 2016 aged 18 or older (N=56 407). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of use of the five unscheduled NHS services in the last 12 months of life by underlying cause of death, patient demographics, Continuous Unscheduled Pathways (CUPs) followed by patients during each care episode, total NHS and per-patient costs. RESULTS: 53 509 patients (94.9%) had at least one contact with an unscheduled care service during their last year of life (472 360 contacts), with 34.2% in the last month of life. By linking patient contacts during each episode of care, we identified 206 841 CUPs, with 133 980 (64.8%) starting out-of-hours. People with cancer were more likely to contact the NHS telephone advice line (63%) (χ(2) (4)=1004, p<0.001) or primary care out-of-hours (62%) (χ(2) (4)=1924, p<0.001) and have hospital admissions (88%) (χ(2) (4)=2644, p<0.001). People with organ failure (79%) contacted the ambulance service most frequently (χ(2) (4)=584, p<0.001). Demographic factors associated with more unscheduled care were older age, social deprivation, living in own home and dying of cancer. People dying with organ failure formed the largest group in the cohort and had the highest NHS costs as a group. The cost of providing services in the community was estimated at 3.9% of total unscheduled care costs despite handling most out-of-hours calls.

Bovine besnoitiosis is difficult to control due to the complexity of its diagnosis in the acute stage of the disease, poor treatment success and chronically asymptomatic cattle acting as parasite reservoirs. When serological prevalence is low, detection and specific culling of seropositive cattle is feasible; however, economic considerations preclude this approach when serological prevalence is high. The aims of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of detection of super-spreaders in highly infected herds and to test their selective elimination as a new control strategy for bovine besnoitiosis. METHODS: Previous real-time PCR analyses performed on skin tissues from 160 asymptomatic animals sampled at slaughterhouses showed that the tail base was the best location to evaluate the dermal parasite DNA load. All seropositive animals (n = 518) from eight dairy or beef cattle farms facing a high serological prevalence of besnoitiosis were sampled at the tail base and their skin sample analysed by real-time PCR. A recommendation of rapid and selective culling of super-spreaders was formulated and provided to the cattle breeders. Subsequent serological monitoring of naïve animals was used to evaluate the interest of this control strategy over time. RESULTS: Among the 518 seropositive animals, a low proportion of individuals (14.5%) showed Cq values below 36, 17.8% had doubtful results (36 < Cq ≤ 40) and 67.8% had negative PCR results. These proportions were grossly similar on the eight farms, regardless of their production type (beef or dairy cattle), size, geographical location or history of besnoitiosis. Within two weeks of the biopsy, the rapid culling of super-spreaders was implemented on only three farms. The numbers of newly infected animals were lower on these farms compared to those where super-spreaders were maintained in the herd. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time PCR analyses performed on skin biopsies of seropositive cattle showed huge individual variabilities in parasite DNA load. The rapid culling of individuals considered as super-spreaders seems to be a new and encouraging strategy for bovine besnoitiosis control.

Dyspnoeic cats often have significant underlying disease. Underlying aetiologies in cats that presented with dyspnoea were reviewed, and associations with patient signalment and outcome were investigated. Methods: The case records of 90 dyspnoeic cats were retrospectively reviewed and separated into different groups depending on aetiology (cardiac, respiratory, neoplastic and trauma). Duration of clinical signs, presentation, hospitalisation length and survival were analysed. Results: Cardiac (38 per cent), respiratory (32 per cent) and neoplastic (20 per cent) diseases were common causes of feline dyspnoea. Cats with respiratory causes had longer duration of clinical signs (P<0·001) before presentation. Cats with neoplasia were significantly older (P<0·001). No significant difference in respiratory rates was present between the groups (P = 0·154). High heart rates (P<0·001) and abnormalities on cardiac auscultation were more likely in the cardiac group. Clinical Significance: Frequent causes of dyspnoea in cats were cardiac disease followed by respiratory causes and neoplastic conditions.

The main virulence determinant of most pathogenic proteobacteria is the type three secretion system (T3SS). The Xanthomonas genus includes bacteria responsible for numerous epidemics in agroecosystems worldwide and represents a major threat to plant health. The main virulence factor of Xanthomonas is the Hrp2 family T3SS; however, this system is not conserved in all strains and it has not been previously determined whether the distribution of T3SS in this bacterial genus has resulted from losses or independent acquisitions. Based on comparative genomics of 82 genome sequences representing the diversity of the genus, we have inferred three ancestral acquisitions of the Hrp2 cluster during Xanthomonas evolution followed by subsequent losses in some commensal strains and re‐acquisition in some species. While mutation was the main force driving polymorphism at the gene level, interspecies homologous recombination of large fragments expanding through several genes shaped Hrp2 cluster polymorphism. Horizontal gene transfer of the entire Hrp2 cluster also occurred. A reduced core effectome composed of xopF1, xopM, avrBs2 and xopR was identified that may allow commensal strains overcoming plant basal immunity. In contrast, stepwise accumulation of numerous type 3 effector genes was shown in successful pathogens responsible for epidemics. Our data suggest that capacity to intimately interact with plants through T3SS would be an ancestral trait of xanthomonads. Since its acquisition, T3SS has experienced a highly dynamic evolutionary history characterized by intense gene flux between species that may reflect its role in host adaptation.",2017-09-29,"Merda, Déborah; Briand, Martial; Bosis, Eran; Rousseau, Céline; Portier, Perrine; Barret, Matthieu; Jacques, Marie‐Agnès; Fischer‐Le Saux, Marion",Mol Ecol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ac274c4280249196a1f3f31bb8df28017465b1ca.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168496.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168496/,

It is caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and can have a zoonotic origin. Nearly 57,000 people die yearly from hepatitis E‐related conditions. The disease is endemic in both developing and developed countries with distinct epidemiologic profiles. In developing countries, the disease is associated with inadequate water treatment, while in developed countries, transmission is associated with animal contact and the ingestion of raw or uncooked meat, especially liver. All human HEV are grouped into at least four genotypes, while HEV or HEV‐related viruses have been identified in an increasing number of domestic and wild animal species. Despite a high genetic diversity, only one single HEV serotype has been described to date for HEV genotypes 1–4. The discovery of new HEV or HEV‐related viruses leads to a continuing increase in the number of genotypes. In addition, the genome organization of all these viruses is variable with overlapping open reading frames (ORF) and differences in the location of ORF3. In spite of the role of some domestic and wild animals as reservoir, the origin of HEV and HEV‐related viruses in humans and animals is still unclear.

MiR22-5p regulated the expression of ESR2, but did not directly affect methylation of its promoter region (–197/+359).

In this study, we evaluate the effect of xenon treatment on functional outcome, lesion volume, neuronal loss and neuroinflammation after severe TBI in rats. METHODS: Young adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) brain trauma or sham surgery followed by treatment with either 50% xenon:25% oxygen balance nitrogen, or control gas 75% nitrogen:25% oxygen. Locomotor function was assessed using Catwalk-XT automated gait analysis at baseline and 24 h after injury. Histological outcomes were assessed following perfusion fixation at 15 min or 24 h after injury or sham procedure. RESULTS: Xenon treatment reduced lesion volume, reduced early locomotor deficits, and attenuated neuronal loss in clinically relevant cortical and subcortical areas. Xenon treatment resulted in significant increases in Iba1-positive microglia and GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes that was associated with neuronal preservation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that xenon improves functional outcome and reduces neuronal loss after brain trauma in rats. Neuronal preservation was associated with a xenon-induced enhancement of microglial cell numbers and astrocyte activation, consistent with a role for early beneficial neuroinflammation in xenon’s neuroprotective effect.

RESULTS: The reporter virus encodes a Gag protein containing NanoLuc inserted between the matrix (MA) and capsid (CA) domains of Gag, thereby generating virus particles that package high levels of the NanoLuc reporter. We observe that inserting the NanoLuc protein within HIV-1 Gag has minimal impact on Gag expression and virus particle release. We show that the reporter virus recapitulates inhibition of HIV-1 particle release by Gag mutations, the restriction factor tetherin, and the small-molecule inhibitor amphotericin-B methyl ester.

It is divided into two broad classes: classical strains that are a notable problem in health care settings due to multidrug resistance, and hypervirulent (hv) strains that are historically drug sensitive but able to establish disease in immunocompetent hosts. Alarmingly, there has been an increased frequency of clinical isolates that have both drug resistance and hv-associated genes. One such gene, rmpA, encodes a transcriptional regulator required for maximal capsule (cps) gene expression and confers hypermucoviscosity (HMV). This link has resulted in the assumption that HMV is caused by elevated capsule production. However, we recently reported a new cps regulator, RmpC, and ΔrmpC mutants have reduced cps expression but retain HMV, suggesting that capsule production and HMV may be separable traits. Here, we report the identification of a small protein, RmpD, that is essential for HMV but does not impact capsule. RmpD is 58 residues with a putative N-terminal transmembrane domain and highly positively charged C-terminal half, and it is conserved among other hv K. pneumoniae strains. Expression of rmpD in trans complements both ΔrmpD and ΔrmpA mutants for HMV, suggesting that RmpD is the key driver of this phenotype. The rmpD gene is located between rmpA and rmpC, within an operon regulated by RmpA. These data, combined with our previous work, suggest a model in which the RmpA-associated phenotypes are largely due to RmpA activating the expression of rmpD to produce HMV and rmpC to stimulate cps expression.",2020-09-22,"Walker, Kimberly A.; Treat, Logan P.; Sepúlveda, Victoria E.; Miller, Virginia L.",mBio,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0af7f259ea782ee40a12cfdacc64a3c3b89b7647.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7512549.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7512549/,

Currently, limited immunomodulator is available to counteract IAV-associated pneumonia in the clinic. Sinensetin, a polymethoxylated flavone with five methoxy groups, has been found to possess anti-agiogenesis, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities. However, the effects of sinensetin on IAV-triggered pro-inflammatory response remain unclear. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effects and corresponding possible mechanism of sinensetin in IAV-infected A549 cells were subjected to investigations. METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of sinensetin towards A549 cells was detected by MTT and LDH assays. The antiviral activity of sinensetin against influenza A virus was assayed in A549 cells with an engineered replication-competent influenza A virus carrying Gaussia luciferase reporter gene infection. The effect of sinensetin on influenza A virus-triggered inflammatory reaction was determined by qRT-PCR, Luminex assays, ELISA and Western blot. RESULTS: Our results showed that sinensetin did not exhibit antiviral activity against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). Meanwhile, sinensetin treatment significantly decreased IAV-induced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators at mRNA and protein levels, including IL-6, TNF-α, IP-10, IL-8 and MCP-1. Additionally, levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the downstream product prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) up-regulated by IAV infection were dramatically suppressed by sinensetin. The mechanistic investigation revealed that sinensetin treatment suppressed the NF-κB transcriptional activity using the NF-κB reporter stable HEK293 cell line stimulated with TNF-α (20 ng/mL) or influenza H1N1 virus. Furthermore, sinensetin abrogated influenza H1N1 virus-induced activation of NF-κB, ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK signalings. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results indicated that sinensetin has potential capacity to attenuate IAV-triggered pro-inflammatory response via inactivation of NF-κB, ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK signalings, which implied that sinensetin may be a promising candidate drug for influenza H1N1 virus infection therapeutics.",2020-05-05,"Li, Jiashun; Jie, Xiang; Liang, Xiaoli; Chen, Ziyu; Xie, Peifang; Pan, Xiping; Zhou, Beixian; Li, Jing",BMC Complement Med Ther,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a44c40cd6e5f432c3cefa74811dfc3ce27a77f29.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200050.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7200050/,

Although families caring for children with rare diseases are known to be at risk for mental disorders, the evaluation of special programs under high methodological standards has not been conducted so far. Moreover, the implementation of interventions for this group into regular care has not yet been accomplished in Germany. The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a family-based intervention will be assessed. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a 2x2 factorial randomized controlled multicenter trial conducted at 17 study centers throughout Germany. Participants are families with children and adolescents affected by a rare disease aged 0 to 21 years. Families in the face-to-face intervention CARE-FAM, online intervention WEP-CARE or the combination of both will be treated over a period of roughly 6 months. Topics discussed in the interventions include coping, family relations, and social support. Families in the control condition will receive treatment as usual. The primary efficacy outcome is parental mental health, measured by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I) by blinded external raters. Further outcomes will be assessed from the parents’ as well as the children’s perspective. Participants are investigated at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months after randomization. In addition to the assessment of various psychosocial outcomes, a comprehensive health-economic evaluation will be performed. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of two family-based intervention programs for Children Affected by Rare Disease and their Family’s Network (CARE-FAM-NET) in German standard care. A methodologically challenging study design is used to reflect the complexity of the actual medical care situation. This trial could be an important contribution to the improvement of care for this highly burdened group.

OBJECTIVES: Spinal cord injury (SCI)-associated pneumonia (SCI-AP) is associated with poor functional recovery and a major cause of death after SCI. Better tackling SCI-AP requires a common understanding on how SCI-AP is defined. This survey examines clinical algorithms relevant for diagnosis and treatment of SCI-AP. SETTING: All departments for SCI-care in Germany. METHODS: The clinical decision-making on SCI-AP and the utility of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for diagnosis of ‘clinically defined pneumonia’ were assessed by means of a standardized questionnaire including eight case vignettes of suspected SCI-AP. The diagnostic decisions based on the case information were analysed using classification and regression trees (CART). RESULTS: The majority of responding departments were aware of the CDC-criteria (88%). In the clinical vignettes, 38–81% of the departments diagnosed SCI-AP in accordance with the CDC-criteria and 7–41% diagnosed SCI-AP in deviation from the CDC-criteria. The diagnostic agreement was not associated with the availability of standard operating procedures for SCI-AP management in the departments. CART analysis identified radiological findings, fever, and worsened gas exchange as most important for the decision on SCI-AP. Frequently requested supplementary diagnostics were microbiological analyses, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin. For empirical antibiotic therapy, the departments used (acyl-)aminopenicillins/β-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins, or combinations of (acyl-)aminopenicillins/β-lactamase inhibitors with fluoroquinolones or carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: This survey reveals a diagnostic ambiguity regarding SCI-AP despite the awareness of CDC-criteria and established SOPs.

The preexisting VP2-specific naive CD4(+) T cells promoted the pathogenesis of the disease in a dose-dependent manner. The transferred VP2-specific CD4(+) T cells proliferated rapidly in the CNS starting at 2–3 dpi. High levels of FoxP3(+)CD4(+) T cells were found in the CNS early in viral infection (3 dpi) and persisted throughout the infection. Activated VP2-specific FoxP3(+)CD4(+) T cells inhibited the production of IFN-γ, but not IL-17, via the same VP2-specific CD4(+) T cells without interfering in proliferation.

The functional abilities of a species, such as its plasticity in various environments, can determine its distribution, species richness and beta diversity patterns. In this study, we evaluate how functional traits influence the distribution of amphibians, and hypothesize which functional traits explain the current pattern of amphibian species composition. LOCATION: Atlantic Forest, Brazil. TAXON: Amphibia (Anura and Gymnophiona) METHODS: Using potential distributions of Brazilian amphibians from Atlantic Forest based on their functional traits, we analysed the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on species richness, endemism (with permutation multivariate analysis) and beta diversity components (i.e. total, turnover and nestedness dissimilarities). RESULTS: Environmental variables explained 59.5% of species richness, whereas functional traits explained 15.8% of species distribution (geographical species range) for Anuran and 88.8% for Gymnophiona. Body size had the strongest correlation with species distribution. Results showed that species with medium to large body size, and species that are adapted to living in open areas tended to disperse from west to east direction. Current forest changes directly affected beta diversity patterns (i.e. most species adapted to novel environments increase their ranges). Beta diversity partitioning between humid and dry forests showed decreased nestedness and increased turnover by increasing altitude in the south‐eastern region of the Atlantic Forest. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that functional traits directly influence the ability of the species to disperse. With the alterations of the natural environment, species more apt to these alterations have dispersed or increased their distribution, which consequently changes community structure. As a result, there are nested species distribution patterns and homogenization of amphibian species composition throughout the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.",2019-10-17,"Lourenço‐de‐Moraes, Ricardo; Campos, Felipe S.; Ferreira, Rodrigo B.; Beard, Karen H.; Solé, Mirco; Llorente, Gustavo A.; Bastos, Rogério P.",J Biogeogr,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f2818a825f65d4a352e8acba4a89064270602a10.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5a7d8cbdd81a5e2cb303e942d176b87e3eef532d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166796.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166796/,

Despite technological progress, the number of targetable antigens or specific antibodies is limited, thus hindering the full potential of recent therapeutic interventions. All possibilities of finding new targeting molecules must be exploited. The specificity of targeting is guaranteed by the use of monoclonal antibodies, while fully human antibodies are preferred, as they are functional and generate no neutralizing antibodies. The aim of this review is to appraise the latest advances in screening methods dedicated to the identification and harnessing of fully human antibodies. The scope of identifying useful molecules proceeds along two avenues, i.e., through the antigen-first or binding-first approaches. The first relies on screening human antibody libraries or plasma from immunized transgenic mice or humans to isolate binders to specific antigens. The latter takes advantage of specific binding to tumor cells of antibodies present in phage display libraries or in responders’ plasma samples without prior knowledge of the antigens. Additionally, next-generation sequencing analysis of B-cell receptor repertoire pre- and post-therapy in memory B-cells from responders allows for the identification of clones expanded and matured upon treatment.

The results of the meta-analysis showed that pooled relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.03) for the effect of MgSO(4) on IVH. CONCLUSION: Results of this study showed that although MgSO(4) had a protective effect on IVH in premature infants, this effect was not statistically significant. Further studies are needed to determine the best dosage, timing, and gestational age to achieve the optimum effect of MgSO(4) on IVH.

Efforts to restore grasslands often assume that removal of woody plants benefits biodiversity but assumptions are rarely tested. In the Chihuahuan Desert of the Southwestern United States, we tested whether abundances of grassland specialist bird species would be greater in plant communities resulting from treatment with herbicides to remove encroaching shrubs compared with untreated shrub‐dominated areas that represented pre‐treatment conditions. In 2010, we surveyed breeding birds and vegetation at 16 treated–untreated pairs. In 2011, we expanded the survey effort to 21 treated–untreated pairs, seven unpaired treatment areas, and five reference grassland areas. Vegetation in treatment areas had higher perennial grass foliar and basal cover and lower shrub foliar cover compared with untreated areas. Several regionally declining grassland specialists exhibited higher occurrence and relative abundance in treated areas. A shrubland specialist, however, was associated with untreated areas and may be negatively impacted by shrub removal. Bird community composition differed between treated and untreated areas in both years. Our results indicate that shrub removal can have positive effects on grassland specialist bird species, but that a mosaic of treated and untreated areas might be most beneficial for regional biodiversity.",2014-01-29,"Coffman, John M.; Bestelmeyer, Brandon T.; Kelly, Jeffrey F.; Wright, Timothy F.; Schooley, Robert L.",Restor Ecol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/91d997714dab8c2d1b0f480a5d23eb2cb2c8d02d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169160.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169160/,

Our aim was to compare the effect of these two modes on oxygenation in infants with evolving or established bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Two-hour periods of PAV and NAVA were delivered in random order to 18 infants born less than 32 weeks of gestation. Quasi oxygenation indices (“OI”) and alveolar-arterial (“A-a”) oxygen gradients at the end of each period on PAV, NAVA and baseline ventilation were calculated using capillary blood samples. The mean “OI” was not significantly different on PAV compared to NAVA (7.8 (standard deviation (SD) 3.2) versus 8.1 (SD 3.4), respectively, p = 0.70, but lower on both than on baseline ventilation (mean baseline “OI” 11.0 (SD 5.0)), p = 0.002, 0.004, respectively).

PKs represent attractive targets for drugs against a wide spectrum of diseases, including viral infections. Two different approaches are being applied in the search for antivirals: compounds directed against viral targets (direct-acting antivirals, DAAs), or against cellular components essential for the viral life cycle (host-directed antivirals, HDAs). One of the main drawbacks of DAAs is the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses. In contrast, HDAs present a higher barrier to resistance development.

Emerging of its antibiotic-resistant strains persuade researchers to find alternative treatment options such as immunization against the notorious nosocomial pathogen. Oma87 has been introduced as an immunogenic outer membrane protein via reverse vaccinology. However, protectivity of A. baumannii Oma87 is not well known. The current research undertakes a study on the immunogenicity of recombinant Oma87 in a murine model. Some physico-chemical properties were assessed via in silico analyses. The corresponding gene was amplified and cloned into pET28a plasmid. The recombinant protein was purified and then was administered to immunize mice. Sera obtained from the immunized mice were assessed with respect to the triggered antibodies. Challenges were performed on actively or passively immunized mice. In silico analyses revealed that this protein is the same as BamA. A high titer of specific antibody was raised against rOma87 even after the first injection. The specific antibody recognized the whole cell of A. baumannii. Both active and passive immunizations confer 100 and 50% protection, respectively against ~ 2 × lethal dose (LD) of A. baumannii in the murine sepsis model. Although none of mice received ~ 5 × LD of A. baumannii survived in passive immunization, 25% of mice challenged with ~ 7 × LD of the bacteria survived and the dead mice exhibited a delayed death. Based on these results, Oma87 is the same as BamA which could be considered as a promising vaccine candidate against A. baumannii in the sepsis model.

This study examines effects of geriatric-specific variables on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing elective major abdominal operations. METHODS: Patients included in the ACS NSQIP pilot Geriatric Surgery Research File program who underwent elective pancreatic, liver, and colorectal operations between 2014 and 2016 were examined. Multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate associations between patient-specific geriatric variables and risk of death, morbidity, readmission, and discharge destination. RESULTS: A total of 4165 patients were included. Patients ≥85 years were more likely to die, experience postoperative morbidity, and be discharged to a facility (all p ≤ 0.039) than younger patients. Preoperatively, patients ≥85 years were more likely to use a mobility aid, have a prior fall, have consent signed by a surrogate, and to live alone at home prior to operation (all p < 0.001). After adjustment for ACS NSQIP-estimated probabilities of morbidity or mortality, no geriatric-specific preoperative risk factors were significantly associated with increased risk of death or complications in any age group (all p > 0.055). Patients 75–84 and ≥85 years were more likely to be discharged to facility (OR 2.33 and 4.75, respectively, both p < 0.001) compared to patients 65–74 years. All geriatric-specific variables: use of mobility aid, living alone, consent signed by a surrogate, and fall history, were significantly associated with discharge to a facility (all p ≤ 0.001).

Therefore, the identification of new effective diagnostic and late prognostic biomarkers is of fundamental importance for the management of this tumor type. In our previous computational study, we have identified a set of microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly dysregulated in oral cancer and with a potential diagnostic and prognostic significance for oral cancer patients. Starting from our preliminary bioinformatics results, the aim of the present study was to validate the diagnostic potential of four selected miRNAs, hsa-miR-133a-3p, hsa-miR-375-3p, hsa-miR-503-5p and hsa-miR-196a-5p, in liquid biopsy samples obtained from oral cancer patients and healthy donors. For this purpose, the expression levels of the selected miRNAs were determined in plasma samples by using specific miRNA probes and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The ddPCR results showed that the hsa-miR-133a-3p and hsa-miR-375-3p were significantly down-regulated in oral cancer and their evaluation in liquid biopsy samples can predict the risk of oral cancer development with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, the computational analysis of miRNA expression and clinical-pathological features of patients allowed us to establish the functional role and prognostic significance of the two validated miRNAs. ABSTRACT: Despite the availability of screening programs, oral cancer deaths are increasing due to the lack of diagnostic biomarkers leading to late diagnosis and a poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover novel effective biomarkers for this tumor. On these bases, the aim of this study was to validate the diagnostic potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) through the analysis of liquid biopsy samples obtained from ten oral cancer patients and ten healthy controls. The expression of four selected miRNAs was evaluated by using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in a pilot cohort of ten oral cancer patients and ten healthy donors. Bioinformatics analyses were performed to assess the functional role of these miRNAs. The expression levels of the predicted down-regulated hsa-miR-133a-3p and hsa-miR-375-3p were significantly reduced in oral cancer patients compared to normal individuals while no significant results were obtained for the up-regulated hsa-miR-503-5p and hsa-miR-196a-5p. ROC analysis confirmed the high sensitivity and specificity of hsa-miR-375-3p and hsa-miR-133a-3p. Therefore, both miRNAs are significantly down-regulated in cancer patients and can be used as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of oral cancer. The analysis of circulating miRNAs in a larger series of patients is mandatory to confirm the results obtained in this pilot study.",2020-11-06,"Crimi, Salvatore; Falzone, Luca; Gattuso, Giuseppe; Grillo, Caterina Maria; Candido, Saverio; Bianchi, Alberto; Libra, Massimo",Biology (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8f01b61b673b115984349c579979f85d2c07092f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7694750.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7694750/,

Our aim was to compare more recent measures, i.e. FOUR score and automated pupillometry, to standard monitoring with the GCS and visual inspection of pupils. METHODS: Supervised trained nursing staff examined a consecutive sample of patients admitted to the neuro-ICU of a tertiary referral centre using GCS and FOUR score and assessing pupillary function first by visual inspection and then by automated pupillometry. Clinical outcome was evaluated 6 months after admission using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. RESULTS: Fifty-six consecutive patients (median age 63 years) were assessed a total of 234 times. Of the 36 patients with at least one GCS score of 3, 13 had a favourable outcome. All seven patients with at least one FOUR score of ≤ 3 had an unfavourable outcome, which was best predicted by a low “brainstem” sub-score. Compared to automated pupillometry, visual assessment underestimated pupillary diameters (median difference, 0.4 mm; P = 0.006). Automated pupillometry detected a preserved pupillary light reflex in 10 patients, in whom visual inspection had missed pupillary constriction. DISCUSSION: Training of nursing staff to implement frequent monitoring of patients in the neuro-ICU with FOUR score and automated pupillometry is feasible. Both measures provide additional clinical information compared to the GCS and visual assessment of pupillary function, most importantly a more granular classification of patients with low levels of consciousness by the FOUR score.",2020-05-07,"Olsen, Markus Harboe; Jensen, Helene Ravnholt; Ebdrup, Søren Røddik; Topp, Nina Hvid; Strange, Ditte Gry; Møller, Kirsten; Kondziella, Daniel",Acta Neurochir (Wien),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1967735aad5ea79d8a4b746ab3e948387f576f5e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7223804.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223804/,

A total of 50 cassava fields distributed among 18 municipalities were visited and intensity of anthracnose evaluated. The highest disease incidence (DI) (83.3%) was in samples collected in São Félix, and the lowest (34.4%), in Varzedo. Municipalities that presented the highest values for DI were located within the ‘Af’ Köppen–Geiger eco-zone, also presenting the highest values for the estimated McKinney disease index. Based on previous studies of multilocus phylogeny, seven different species of Colletotrichum were identified (Colletotrichum fructicola, Colletotrichum tropicale, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.s, Colletotrichum theobromicola, Colletotrichum siamense, Colletotrichum brevisporum and Colletotrichum plurivorum) and a new approach based on ERIC-PCR was used aiming to group the 82 isolates according to these findings.

This research provides geographical incidence and cost models of this disease in the U.S. and explanatory models to account for hospitals’ number of heart failure DRGs using technical, workload, financial, geographical, and time-related variables. Methods: The number of diagnoses is forecast using regression (constrained and unconstrained) and ensemble (random forests, extra trees regressor, gradient boosting, and bagging) techniques at the hospital unit of analysis. Descriptive maps of heart failure diagnostic-related groups (DRGs) depict areas of high incidence. State- and county-level spatial and non-spatial regression models of heart failure admission rates are performed. Expenditure forecasts are estimated. Results: The incidence of heart failure has increased over time with the highest intensities in the East and center of the country; however, several Northern states have seen large increases since 2016. The best predictive model for the number of diagnoses (hospital unit of analysis) was an extremely randomized tree ensemble (predictive R(2) = 0.86). The important variables in this model included workload metrics and hospital type. State-level spatial lag models using first-order Queen criteria were best at estimating heart failure admission rates (R(2) = 0.816). At the county level, OLS was preferred over any GIS model based on Moran’s I and resultant R(2); however, none of the traditional models performed well (R(2) = 0.169 for the OLS). Gradient-boosted tree models predicted 36% of the total sum of squares; the most important factors were facility workload, mean cash on hand of the hospitals in the county, and mean equity of those hospitals. Online interactive maps at the state and county levels are provided. Conclusions. Heart failure and associated expenditures are increasing. Costs of DRGs in the study increased $61 billion from 2016 through 2018. The increase in the more expensive DRG 291 outpaced others with an associated increase of $92 billion. With the increase in demand and steady-state supply of cardiologists, the costs are likely to balloon over the next decade.

They have two classical functions, the barrier function and the fence function. The former regulates the passage of ions, water and various molecules through paracellular spaces, and is thus related to edema, jaundice, diarrhea and blood‐borne metastasis. The latter function maintains cell polarity by forming a fence to prevent intermixing of molecules in the apical membrane with those in the lateral membrane. This function is deeply involved in cancer cell properties in terms of loss of cell polarity. Recently, two novel aspects of tight junctions have been reported. One is their involvement in signal transduction. The other is that fact that tight junctions are considered to be a crucial component of innate immunity. In addition, since some proteins comprising tight junctions work as receptors for viruses and extracellular stimuli, pathogenic bacteria and viruses target and affect the tight junction functions, leading to diseases. In this review, the relationship between tight junctions and human diseases will be described.",2013-01-07,"Sawada, Norimasa",Pathol Int,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/76d80d77cec3849e2561a1965299e2605af39fcf.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168075.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168075/,

Data for the review were comprised of articles published between 1970 and 2012. References of all the cited articles were also reviewed. RESULTS: Available evidence suggests that music-based interventions may have a positive impact on pain, anxiety, mood disturbance, and quality of life in cancer patients. Advances in neurobiology may provide insight into the potential mechanisms by which music impacts these outcomes.

It usually causes mild upper- and lower-respiratory tract infections. HBoV infection seems to be rare during adulthood, probably due to high antibody titers resulting from childhood infection and seroconversion. The clinical significance, possible complications, and consequences of an adulthood infection are still unclear. Furthermore, the consequences of HBoV infection during pregnancy are seldom reported in the literature. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 22-year-old pregnant woman in her third trimester who presented with a 1-week history of fever and cough followed by progressive shortness of breath. She was treated initially as a case of severe pneumonia; however, her condition deteriorated rapidly, resulting in hypoxic respiratory failure that required intensive care support. The patient was found to have dilated cardiomyopathy on echocardiography, and her fetal ultrasound showed no fetal heart activity; subsequently, labor induction for stillbirth was performed. An extensive workup for an underlying cause was unrevealing apart from positive respiratory viral PCR assay for human bocavirus, performed twice. A provisional diagnosis of HBoV pneumonia complicated by dilated cardiomyopathy, stillbirth, and multiorgan failure was made. Fortunately, the patient had a good recovery and was discharged home in good clinical condition. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to severe pneumonia, HBoV infection may result in other life-threatening complications. Although the infection is rare during adulthood, infection in a pregnant woman should be taken seriously and close monitoring of such patients is advised.",2021-01-13,"Bishawi, Ahmad Al; Ben Abid, Fatma; Ibrahim, Wanis",Am J Case Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8838072d5e134a5a92d330a2aba37ff8d6e1b429.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7811980.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7811980/,

We aimed to (1) identify levels of emotion, perceived risk and behaviour change with regard to visiting Salisbury, 1 month after three people were poisoned with a nerve agent; and (2) test whether factors including receipt of information, beliefs about personal exposure and trust in government were associated with these outcomes. DESIGN: A cross-sectional telephone survey of a random sample of Salisbury residents. SETTING: Conducted between 5 and 13 April 2018. PARTICIPANTS: 500 residents aged 18 or over. OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported anxiety, anger, uncertainty, perceived risk to self and avoidance of Salisbury. RESULTS: Any degree of anxiety, anger and uncertainty was reported by 40.6%, 29.8% and 30.6% of participants, respectively. For the majority, the level of emotion reported was mild. Only 7.0% met the criteria for high anxiety and 5.2% reported feeling any risk to their health, whereas 18.6% reported avoiding Salisbury. Factors associated with avoidance of Salisbury included being female, unable to rule out exposure for oneself or of loved ones, believing the incident was targeted against the general public, and lower trust in the government and responding agencies. Hearing a lot or a little about the recovery support (eg, financial packages), as opposed to nothing at all, and being satisfied with this information were associated with reduced avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: Although the March 2018 Salisbury incident had a relatively modest impact on emotion and risk perception in the community, the number who reported avoiding the city was notable.

Data on the prevalence and frequency of these encounters are lacking and are needed to guide the creation of institutional trainings and policies to support trainees. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of resident experiences with and responses to a range of biased patient behaviors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective survey was sent via email to 331 second- and third-year internal medicine residents from 3 academic medical centers in California and North Carolina. First-year residents were excluded owing to their limited interactions with patients at the time of participant recruitment. Data were collected from August 21 to November 25, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Descriptive statistics were used to report the frequency of experience of various types of biased patient behavior, residents’ responses, the factors impeding residents’ responses, and residents’ experiences and beliefs regarding training and policies. RESULTS: Overall, 232 of 331 residents (70%) participated; 116 (50%) were women; 116 of 247 (47%) were White (participants had the option of selecting >1 race/ethnicity); and 23 (10%) identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer. The frequency of resident-reported experience of types of biased patient behaviors varied. The most common behaviors—belittling comments and assumption of nonphysician status—were reported to be experienced 1 or more times per week by 14% of residents (32 of 231) and 17% of residents (38 of 230), respectively. Women, Black or Latinx, and Asian residents reported experiencing biased behavior more frequently. Forty-five percent of Black or Latinx residents (17 of 38) encountered instances of explicit epithets or rejection of care. All 70 Asian residents reported experiencing inquiries into their ethnic origins. Most women residents (110 of 115 [96%]) experienced role questioning behaviors, and 87% (100 of 115) experienced sexual harassment. The need to prioritize clinical care and a sense of futility in responding were the most common factors (cited by 34% of residents [76 of 227] and 25% of residents [56 of 227], respectively) significantly impeding responses to biased behaviors. Eighty-five percent of residents (191 of 226) never reported incidents to their institution. Eighty-nine percent of residents (206 of 232) identified training and policies as necessary or very necessary. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This survey study suggests that biased patient behavior is experienced frequently by internal medicine residents.

However, the full data set often contains thousands of sequences, because many of those unique sequences have multiple identical copies. Data sets of this size represent a computational challenge for currently available Bayesian phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods. Through simulations, we explore how large data sets with duplicate sequences affect the speed and accuracy of phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis within BEAST 2. We show that using unique sequences only leads to biases, and using a random subset of sequences yields imprecise parameter estimates. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce PIQMEE, a BEAST 2 add-on that produces reliable parameter estimates from full data sets with increased computational efficiency as compared with the currently available methods within BEAST 2. The principle behind PIQMEE is to resolve the tree structure of the unique sequences only, while simultaneously estimating the branching times of the duplicate sequences. Distinguishing between unique and duplicate sequences allows our method to perform well even for very large data sets. Although the classic method converges poorly for data sets of 6,000 sequences when allowed to run for 7 days, our method converges in slightly more than 1 day. In fact, PIQMEE can handle data sets of around 21,000 sequences with 20 unique sequences in 14 days.

Specific enzymes within successive compartments of the Golgi apparatus determine where new monomer building blocks are linked to the growing oligomer. These enzymes act promiscuously and stochastically, causing microheterogeneity (molecule-to-molecule variability) in the final oligomer products. However, this variability is tightly controlled: a given eukaryotic protein type is typically associated with a narrow, specific glycan oligomer profile. Here, we use ideas from the mathematical theory of self-assembly to enumerate the enzymatic causes of oligomer variability and show how to eliminate each cause. We rigorously demonstrate that cells can specifically synthesize a larger repertoire of glycan oligomers by partitioning promiscuous enzymes across multiple Golgi compartments. This places limits on biomolecular assembly: glycan microheterogeneity becomes unavoidable when the number of compartments is limited, or enzymes are excessively promiscuous.",2020-06-29,"Jaiman, Anjali; Thattai, Mukund",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4b56f4d0dd1e9c274d5c2fc116005c42dfaeb483.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7360365.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7360365/,

No significant differences were observed when comparing the PFS of high-risk patients receiving EGFR-TKI therapy with the chemotherapy cohorts (median PFS, 6.9 vs 4.4 months; P = .08). In terms of predicting the tumor progression risk after EGFR-TKI therapy, clinical decisions based on the DL semantic signature led to better survival outcomes than those based on radiomics signature across all risk probabilities by the decision curve analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This diagnostic/prognostic study provides a clinically applicable approach for identifying patients with stage IV EGFR variant–positive NSCLC who are not likely to benefit from EGFR-TKI therapy. The end-to-end DL-derived semantic features eliminated all manual interventions required while using previous radiomics methods and have a better prognostic performance.",2020-12-17,"Song, Jiangdian; Wang, Lu; Ng, Nathan Norton; Zhao, Mingfang; Shi, Jingyun; Wu, Ning; Li, Weimin; Liu, Zaiyi; Yeom, Kristen W.; Tian, Jie",JAMA Netw Open,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7747022.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7747022/,

However, how non-enveloped viruses hijack cell machinery to promote non-lytic release in EVs, and their functional roles, remain to be clarified. Here we used Bluetongue virus (BTV) as a model of a non-enveloped arthropod-borne virus and discovered that the majority of viruses are released in EVs. Based on the cellular proteins detected in these EVs, and use of inhibitors targeting the cellular degradation process, we demonstrated that these extracellular vesicles are derived from secretory lysosomes, in which the acidic pH is neutralized upon the infection. Moreover, we report that secreted EVs are more efficient than free-viruses for initiating infections, but that they trigger super-infection exclusion that only free-viruses can overcome.",2020-10-19,"Labadie, Thomas; Roy, Polly",PLoS Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a395e6db6981c0fff6c369bea1e335a917a5282b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7595637.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7595637/,

However, this also involves a decrease in the surface area of the activated carbon filter. The CO(2) elimination and sevoflurane (SEV) reflection of the old device (ACD-100) were thus compared with the new version (ACD-50) in patients sedated after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. After ERC approval and written informed consent, 23 patients were sedated with SEV, using first the ACD-100 and then the ACD-50 for 60 min each. With each device, patients were ventilated with tidal volumes (TV) of 5 ml/kg of ideal body weight for the first 30 min, and with 7 ml/kg for the next 30 min. Ventilation parameters, arterial blood gases, Bispectral-Index™ (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems Inc., Newton, MA, USA), SEV concentrations exhaled by the patient (SEV-exhaled) and from the expiratory hose (SEV-lost) were recorded every 30 min. A SEV reflection index was calculated: SRI [%] = 100 × (1 − (SEV-lost/SEV-exhaled)). Data were compared using ANOVA with repeated measurements and Student’s T-tests for pairs. Respiratory rates, tidal and minute volumes were not significantly different between the two devices. End tidal and arterial CO(2) partial pressures were significantly higher with the ACD-100 as compared with the ACD-50. SEV infusion rate remained constant.

The prohibitive cost of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for most HIV‐infected patients in sub‐Saharan Africa and the serious side effects in those who have access to ARV drugs make a compelling case for the study of complementary and alternative therapies. Such therapies should have scientifically proved antiviral activity and minimal toxic effects. A plant extract, Secomet‐V, with an anecdotal indication in humans for promise as an anti‐HIV treatment, was investigated. Using a previously described attenuated vaccinia virus vGK5, we established the antiviral activity of Secomet‐V. Chemical analysis showed that it has an acidic pH, nontoxic traces of iron (<10 ppm), and almost undetectable levels of arsenic (<1.0 ppm). The color varies from colorless to pale yellow to dark brown. The active agent is heat stable at least up to sterilizing temperature of 121°C. The crude plant extract is a mixture of several small molecules separable by high‐pressure liquid chromatography. The HIV viral loads were significantly reduced over several months in a few patients monitored after treatment with Secomet‐V. Secomet‐V was also found to have antiviral activity against the SARS virus but not against the West Nile virus.

Intraoperative margin control (IOMC) modalities such as fast frozen section (FFS), fast paraffin (FP) and Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) are being increasingly widely used, though there is a lack of information regarding utility. The aim of this study was to survey members of the British Oculoplastic Surgery Society (BOPSS) to determine attitudes and access to different modalities of IOMC. METHODS: A 12-question online survey was disseminated via an e-mail to full members of the BOPSS. The survey was hosted using Qualtrics software via the University of Sussex. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 64 of 165 (38.8%). MMS was readily available in a neighbouring trust to 23 of 64 respondents (35.9%). Seven respondents (10.9%) reported no regional access to MMS. Twenty-nine members had readily available access to FFS (45.3%) and 37 of 64 to FP (57.8%) in their own institution. There is variation in what tumour types would be considered appropriate for IOMC, though most thought clinically ill-defined (morphoeic) basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) should undergo one form of IOMC (90.6% and 81.3%, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study highlights variation in availability and utilisation of IOMC amongst oculoplastic surgeons and in different regions of the UK. While the exact place of IOMC in periocular tumour excision is debated, there is a consistent view that it should be available for some tumours.

Current diagnostic methods have low sensitivities for detection of latent forms of MAP infection, defined by focal granulomatous lesions and scarce humoral response or MAP presence. In contrast, patent infections correspond to multifocal and diffuse types of enteritis where there is increased antibody production, and substantial mycobacterial load. Our previous RNA-Seq analysis allowed the selection of five candidate biomarkers overexpressed in peripheral blood of MAP infected Holstein cows with focal (ABCA13 and MMP8) and diffuse (FAM84A, SPARC and DES) lesions vs. control animals with no detectable PTB-associated lesions in intestine and regional lymph nodes. The aim of the current study was to assess the PTB diagnostic potential of commercial ELISAs designed for the specific detection of these biomarkers. The ability of these ELISAs to identify animals with latent and/or patent forms of MAP infection was investigated using serum from naturally infected cattle (n = 88) and non-infected control animals (n = 67). ROC analysis revealed that the ABCA13-based ELISA showed the highest diagnostic accuracy for the detection of infected animals with focal lesions (AUC 0.837, sensitivity 79.25% and specificity 88.06%) and with any type of histological lesion (AUC 0.793, sensitivity 69.41% and specificity 86.57%) improving on the diagnostic performance of the popular IDEXX ELISA and other conventional diagnostic methods. SPARC and MMP8 showed the highest diagnostic accuracy for the detection of animals with multifocal (AUC 0.852) and diffuse lesions (AUC 0.831), respectively. In conclusion, our results suggest that quantification of ABCA13, SPARC and MMP8 by ELISA has the potential for implementation as a diagnostic tool to reliably identify MAP infection, greatly improving early detection of MAP latent infections when antibody responses and fecal shedding are undetectable using conventional diagnostic methods.",2020-09-03,"Blanco Vázquez, Cristina; Alonso-Hearn, Marta; Juste, Ramón A.; Canive, María; Iglesias, Tania; Iglesias, Natalia; Amado, Javier; Vicente, Fernando; Balseiro, Ana; Casais, Rosa",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/71737bcb28baee76561d4549817c2063ed616a2e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7470414.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470414/,

This protocol describes the setup of Health Telescope, a longitudinal panel study in which the long-term effects of mobile electronic health (eHealth) apps are investigated. By setting up Health Telescope, we aim to (1) understand more about the long-term use of eHealth apps in an externally valid setting, (2) understand the relationships between short-term and long-term outcomes of the usage of eHealth apps, and (3) test different ways in which eHealth app allocation can be personalized. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this paper are to (1) demonstrate and motivate the validity of the many choices that we made in setting up an intensive longitudinal study, (2) provide a resource for researchers interested in using data generated by our study, and (3) act as a guideline for researchers interested in setting up their own longitudinal data collection using wearable devices. For the third objective, we explicitly discuss the General Data Protection Regulation and ethical requirements that need to be addressed. METHODS: In this 4-month study, a group of approximately 450 participants will have their daily step count measured and will be asked daily about their mood using experience sampling. Once per month, participants will receive an intervention containing a recommendation to download an app that focuses on increasing physical activity. The mechanism for assigning recommendations to participants will be personalized over time, using contextual data obtained from previous interventions. RESULTS: The data collection software has been developed, and all the legal and ethical checks are in place. Recruitment will start in Q4 of 2020. The initial results will be published in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The aim of Health Telescope is to investigate how different individuals respond to different ways of being encouraged to increase their physical activity.

However, there is a variety of intervention types, and their differential efficacy is widely unclear. The aim of the planned network meta-analysis (NMA) is to compare the efficacy of family interventions that differ in content (eg, psychoeducation, mutual support, skills training) and format (eg, number of sessions, inclusion of patients, form of delivery). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will include randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions directed at the adult relatives, friends or non-professional carers of people with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (schizophrenia spectrum) to any kind of control condition. The main outcomes will be global clinical state for the patients and coping with psychosis as well as attitudes towards psychosis for the relatives. Additional outcomes will be severity of symptoms, functioning, burden and compliance/drop-out. We conducted a comprehensive search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE(R), PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (8 August 2019) and reference lists of review articles. Full-text assessment of eligibility, data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment will be done by two independent reviewers. An NMA will be conducted for any of the planned outcomes and intervention characteristics for which sufficient and appropriate data are available. The analyses will make use of a random effects model within a frequentist framework. Estimates for all pairwise treatment effects will be obtained using standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. Interventions will be ranked according to their relative efficacy. We will address the assumption of transitivity, heterogeneity and inconsistency using theoretical and statistical approaches. The possibility of publication bias and the strength of evidence will also be examined. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: There are no ethical concerns. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at practitioners’ conferences.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 200 and 400 patients were enrolled daily through the National Pandemic Flu Service (NPFS) and issued with a self-sampling kit. Initially, only persons aged 16 and over were eligible, but from 12 November (week 45), self-sampling was extended to include school-age children (5 years and older). All samples received were screened for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as well as seasonal influenza [A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and influenza B] by a combination of RT–PCR and virus isolation methods. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 RT–PCR-positive samples were screened for the oseltamivir resistance-inducing H275Y substitution, and a subset of samples also underwent phenotypic antiviral susceptibility testing by enzyme inhibition assay. RESULTS: We were able to detect virus by RT–PCR in self-taken samples and recovered infectious virus enabling further virological characterization. The majority of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 RT–PCR-positive NPFS samples (n = 1273) were taken after oseltamivir treatment had begun. No reduction in phenotypic susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors was detected, but five cases with minority quasi-species of oseltamivir-resistant virus (an H275Y amino acid substitution in neuraminidase) were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Self-sampling is a useful tool for community surveillance, particularly for the follow-up of drug-treated patients. The virological study of self-taken samples from the NPFS provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the emergence of oseltamivir resistance in treated individuals with mild illness in the community, a target population that may not be captured by traditional sentinel surveillance schemes.",2013-06-12,"Lackenby, Angie; Elliot, Alex J.; Powers, Cassandra; Andrews, Nick; Ellis, Joanna; Bermingham, Alison; Thompson, Catherine; Galiano, Monica; Large, Shirley; Durnall, Hayley; Fleming, Douglas; Smith, Gillian; Zambon, Maria",J Antimicrob Chemother,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2daace5afe59d896f9823498aada61df7b5a414b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7313964.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313964/,

An early study in a glutamate-induced mouse seizure model demonstrated that GM was one of the active ingredients of UR. In this study, electrophysiological technique was used to explore the mechanism underlying the antiepileptic activity of GM. We first showed that GM (1−30 μmol/L) dose-dependently suppressed the spontaneous firing and prolonged the action potential duration in cultured mouse and rat hippocampal neurons. Given the pivotal roles of ion channels in regulating neuronal excitability, we then examined the effects of GM on both voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels in rat hippocampal neurons. We found that GM is an inhibitor of multiple neuronal channels: GM potently inhibited the voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)), calcium (Ca(V)), and delayed rectifier potassium (I(K)) currents, and the ligand-gated nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) currents with IC(50) values in the range of 1.3−13.3 μmol/L. In contrast, GM had little effect on the voltage-gated transient outward potassium currents (I(A)) and four types of ligand-gated channels (γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate/kainite (AMPA/KA receptors)). The in vivo antiepileptic activity of GM was validated in two electricity-induced seizure models. In the maximal electroshock (MES)-induced mouse seizure model, oral administration of GM (50−100 mg/kg) dose-dependently suppressed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In 6-Hz-induced mouse seizure model, oral administration of GM (100 mg/kg) reduced treatment-resistant seizures. Thus, we conclude that GM is a promising antiepileptic candidate that inhibits multiple neuronal channels.",2020-01-07,"Xie, Zhu-qing; Tian, Xiao-ting; Zheng, Yue-ming; Zhan, Li; Chen, Xue-qin; Xin, Xiao-ming; Huang, Cheng-gang; Gao, Zhao-bing",Acta Pharmacol Sin,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3bc74077af1e9729504c21da1be87278b6290150.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7471432.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471432/,

Chronic stress and depression can result in general dysregulation of the immune system, of both cellular and humoral pathways, which may contribute to pathogenic infection and concomitant periodontal tissue destruction. In general, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that stress can modify the host defense and progression of periodontal infections in patients susceptible to periodontitis. However, substantial evidence also indicates that these conditions can mediate risk for disease, including periodontitis, through changes in health‐related behaviors, such as oral hygiene, smoking and diet. The unequivocal interpretation of studies has also been hampered, in part, by issues related to conceptualization of stress and depression, as well as commonly associated comorbidities, such as diabetes, that can modify the onset and progression of periodontal disease. In addition, stress and depression appear to fall into a spectrum, ranging from mild to severe, involving a complex interaction of genetic background, coping strategies and environment. Differences in the conceptualization of stress and depression are probably important in assessing associations with other biologic and clinical measures.

The field has advanced dramatically over the past 40 years, driven in part by major advances in isolation and manufacturing technologies that have brought these important biologics to the forefront of modern medicine. However, the global uptake of monoclonal antibody (mAb) biologics is impeded by biophysical and biochemical liabilities, production limitations, the need for cold-chain storage and transport, as well as high costs of manufacturing and distribution. Some of these hurdles may be overcome through transient in vivo gene delivery platforms, such as non-viral synthetic plasmid DNA and messenger RNA vectors that are engineered to encode optimized mAb genes. These approaches turn the body into a biological factory for antibody production, eliminating many of the steps involved in bioprocesses and providing several other significant advantages, and differ from traditional gene therapy (permanent delivery) approaches.

METHODS: Based on the concept of needs, we addressed the normative dimension typically characterized by epidemiological data. Based on existing German health system data resources, an explorative approach was utilized to identify and characterize available databases providing information on the patient group and/or their healthcare. RESULTS: To date, no available database provides information on the healthcare needs of this patient group. As of the reporting year 2017, the diagnosis-related groups (DRG) statistics will provide hospital-specific data on home invasive ventilation interventions, but the data do not provide information on long-term care. Claims data may be a promising source for cross-sectoral evaluation of healthcare needs but feature methodological challenges. These results call for efforts to address limited data eligibility, adopt a broader understanding of healthcare needs, and identify actions needed to evidence informed and needs-oriented healthcare.

The economic impact of IoT becoming very important, and it began to be used in the industrial environment under the name of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) concept, which is a sub-domain of IoT. The IIoT changes the way industrial processes are controlled and monitored, increasing operating efficiency. This article proposes a software architecture for IIoT that has a low degree of abstraction compared to the reference architectures presented in the literature. The architecture is organized on four-layer and it integrates the latest concepts related to fog and edge computing. These concepts are activated through the use of fog/edge/gateway nodes, where the processing of data acquired from things is performed and it is the place where things interact with each other in the virtual environment. The main contributions of this paper are the proposal and description of a complete IIoT software architecture, the use of a unified address space, and the use of the computing platform based on SoC (System on Chip) with specialized co-processors in order to be able to execute in real-time certain time-critical operations specific to the industrial environment.",2020-09-30,"Ungurean, Ioan; Gaitan, Nicoleta Cristina",Sensors (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3ab3a0eaac450bd7e5d82f08657760c64de264e3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7583771.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7583771/,

Surgical intervention is warranted in patients with significant neural deficits, and cauda equina syndrome and needs to be performed at the earliest in order to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 29-year-old primigravida in her 21st week of gestational period, who was diagnosed with cauda equina syndrome secondary to two level lumbar disc herniations. The lengthier surgical duration in performing double level disc herniations in an obese patient raises concerns in anesthetic dosing of drugs and surgical positioning which may result in fetal distress. A double level decompression and discectomy in prone position was done under general anesthesia. Despite the surgical challenges, the postoperative period was uneventful resulting in immediate pain relief and complete neurological recovery, followed by the delivery of a 2.7-kg healthy male child. DISCUSSION: Surgical intervention can be performed in pregnancy, to avoid irreversible neurological deficits, even in an obese individual with double level lumbar pathology. However, it is essential that the surgeon appraises the situation and involves an integrated multidisciplinary team comprising anesthetist, spine surgeon, obstetrician, and psychologist, and inculcates certain precautions in the perioperative management to achieve good surgical and fetal outcomes.",2019-04-15,"S, Dilip Chand Raja; Shetty, Ajoy Prasad; Kanna, Rishi Mugesh; Rajasekaran, S",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/32ce64df82bd000ff1ce43be103b3b1a5a26cd87.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6474232.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6474232/,

Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) provides an efficient rewarming method with complete cardiopulmonary support. The use of VA-ECMO for this indication has greatly improved the vital and functional prognosis of patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 46-year-old patient who was treated for severe hypothermia with a temperature of 22.4 °C along with initial cardiac arrest, whose progression was favorable after the implementation of VA-ECMO support. Two months after initial cardiac arrest, the patient was reassessed and showed signs of complete recovery with regard to his mental and physical capacities. CONCLUSIONS: The recent international publications and groups of experts recommend the use of VA ECMO as the gold standard therapy to treat severe hypothermia. Therefore, it seems suitable to update the current knowledge on the topic by analysing the latest international publications. The performance of this technique calls into question ethical and economic factors. Two distinct medical teams tried to identify and regroup prognosis factors in predictive survival scores. They raise the question of the utility of these scores in clinical practice. Indeed, according to which survival rate should we proceed to prolonged resuscitation and implement VA-ECMO?

The present study was aimed at investigating the localization of DIM-1bm in the life-stages of B. malayi to identify the tissue target of vaccine action. METHODS: Recombinant DIM-1bm (rDIM-1bm) was prepared and antibodies were raised in BALB/c mice. Immunoblots of SDS-PAGE resolved B. malayi infective 3rd stage larvae (L(3)) and adult worm antigens and rDIM-1bm were prepared and reacted with anti-rDIM-1bm sera. Sections of adult female worms and whole-mount preparations of L(3) and microfilariae (mf) were stained by immunofluorescence using rDIM-1bm antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488 labeled secondary antibodies, and examined under a confocal microscope. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining showed that DIM-1bm is localized mainly in the subcuticular muscle layer in the L(3) and the adult worms; no fluorescent signal could be detected in mf.

Along with the bounties of smart things and applications, there are hazards of external and internal attacks. Unfortunately, mitigating internal attacks is quite challenging, where network lifespan (w.r.t. energy consumption at node level), latency, and scalability are the three main factors that influence the efficacy of security measures. Furthermore, most of the security measures provide centralized solutions, ignoring the decentralized nature of SN-powered Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. This paper presents an energy-efficient decentralized trust mechanism using a blockchain-based multi-mobile code-driven solution for detecting internal attacks in sensor node-powered IoT. The results validate the better performance of the proposed solution over existing solutions with 43.94% and 2.67% less message overhead in blackhole and greyhole attack scenarios, respectively.

It is well known that the dopamine (DA) transporter is its major target; but cocaine also acts on other targets including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In this study, we investigated the effects of cocaine on a special subtype of neuronal nAChR, α(3)β(4)-nAChR expressed in native SH-SY5Y cells. α(3)β(4)-nAChR-mediated currents were recorded using whole-cell recordings. Drugs were applied using a computer-controlled U-tube drug perfusion system. We showed that bath application of nicotine induced inward currents in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC(50) value of 20 µM. Pre-treatment with cocaine concentration-dependently inhibited nicotine-induced current with an IC(50) of 1.5 μM. Kinetic analysis showed that cocaine accelerated α(3)β(4)-nAChR desensitization, which caused a reduction of the amplitude of nicotine-induced currents. Co-application of nicotine and cocaine (1.5 μM) depressed the maximum response on the nicotine concentration-response curve without changing the EC(50) value, suggesting a non-competitive mechanism. The cocaine-induced inhibition of nicotine response exhibited both voltage- and use-dependence, suggesting an open-channel blocking mechanism. Furthermore, intracellular application of GDP-βS (via recording electrode) did not affect cocaine-induced inhibition, suggesting that cocaine did not alter receptor internalization. Moreover, intracellular application of cocaine (30 µM) failed to alter the nicotine response. Finally, cocaine (1.5 μM) was unable to inhibit the nicotine-induced inward current in heterologous expressed α(6)/α(3)β(2)β(3)-nAChRs and α(4)β(2)-nAChRs expressed in human SH-EP1 cells.

We evaluated whether social media reflects social uneasiness and fear during epidemic outbreaks and natural catastrophes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Freely available epidemic data in Taiwan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We used weekly epidemic incidence data obtained from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and online search query data obtained from Google Trends between 4 October 2015 and 2 April 2016. To validate whether non-English query keywords were useful surveillance tools, we estimated the correlation between online query data and epidemic incidence in Taiwan. RESULTS: With our approach, we noted that keywords 感冒 (‘common cold’), 發燒 (‘fever’) and 咳嗽 (‘cough’) exhibited good to excellent correlation between Google Trends query data and influenza incidence (r=0.898, p<0.001; r=0.773, p<0.001; r=0.796, p<0.001, respectively). They also displayed high correlation with influenza-like illness emergencies (r=0.900, p<0.001; r=0.802, p<0.001; r=0.886, p<0.001, respectively) and outpatient visits (r=0.889, p<0.001; r=0.791, p<0.001; r=0.870, p<0.001, respectively). We noted that the query 腸病毒 (‘enterovirus’) exhibited excellent correlation with the number of enterovirus-infected patients in emergency departments (r=0.914, p<0.001).

In this study, we investigated the tissue distribution of oroxindin and its therapeutic effects on ulcerative colitis (UC) as well as the underlying mechanisms. UC model was established in mice by administrating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 7 d. We first showed that oroxindin was largely absorbed by the colon as an active ingredient after normal mice received Huang-Qin-Tang, a traditional Chinese medicine decoction. UC mice were then treated with oroxindin (12.5, 25, 50 mg ·kg(−1) ·d(−1), i.g.) for 10 d. We found that oroxindin treatment greatly suppressed massive macrophages infiltration and attenuated pathological changes in colonic tissue. Furthermore, oroxindin treatment significantly inhibited the generation of IL-1β and IL-18 in the colon via inhibiting the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome formation and activation. In cultured macrophages, LPS induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation and caspase-1 activation, which were suppressed by oroxindin (12.5–50 μM). In LPS-treated macrophages, oroxindin dose-dependently restored the expression of TXNIP protein, leading to suppressing TXNIP-dependent NF-κB activation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that oroxindin could be absorbed by the colon and attenuate inflammatory responses via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation, which is related to the inhibitory effect on TXNIP-dependent NF-κB-signaling pathway.

To inform planning for an influenza pandemic, we estimated US demand for N95 filtering facepiece respirators (respirators) by healthcare and emergency services personnel and need for surgical masks by pandemic patients seeking care. Methods. We used a spreadsheet-based model to estimate demand for 3 scenarios of respirator use: base case (usage approximately follows epidemic curve), intermediate demand (usage rises to epidemic peak and then remains constant), and maximum demand (all healthcare workers use respirators from pandemic onset). We assumed that in the base case scenario, up to 16 respirators would be required per day per intensive care unit patient and 8 per day per general ward patient. Outpatient healthcare workers and emergency services personnel would require 4 respirators per day. Patients would require 1.2 surgical masks per day. Results and Conclusions. Assuming that 20% to 30% of the population would become ill, 1.7 to 3.5 billion respirators would be needed in the base case scenario, 2.6 to 4.3 billion in the intermediate demand scenario, and up to 7.3 billion in the maximum demand scenario (for all scenarios, between 0.1 and 0.4 billion surgical masks would be required for patients). For pandemics with a lower attack rate and fewer cases (eg, 2009-like pandemic), the number of respirators needed would be higher because the pandemic would have longer duration. Providing these numbers of respirators and surgical masks represents a logistic challenge for US public health agencies. Public health officials must urgently consider alternative use strategies for respirators and surgical masks during a pandemic that may vary from current practices.",2015-05-01,"Carias, Cristina; Rainisch, Gabriel; Shankar, Manjunath; Adhikari, Bishwa B.; Swerdlow, David L.; Bower, William A.; Pillai, Satish K.; Meltzer, Martin I.; Koonin, Lisa M.",Clin Infect Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ad568938a437816b3c7d16b96c098cef5023a1f1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7314226.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314226/,

Three groups of species could be distinguished based on seed survival after LN exposure. In group 1 species, no seedling production could be obtained after LN exposure due to endosperm injury. In group 2 species, recovery was very low or nil after rapid cooling, and only moderate after slow cooling. In group 3 species, very high percentages of seedling development were observed after both rapid and slow cooling. A high interspecific variability for the high moisture freezing limit was observed within the species of groups 2 and 3, since it ranged from 0.14 to 0.26 g H(2)O g(−1) dry weight. A very highly significant correlation was found for those species between the unfreezable water content, as determined from DSC analysis, and the high moisture freezing limit of their seeds.

In this study, we utilized IgA-SEQ to profile IgA-bound fecal bacteria in 48 recurrent Clostridioides difficile patients before and after successful fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to gain further insight. Prior to FMT, Escherichia coli was the most highly IgA-targeted taxon; following restoration of the microbiota by FMT, highly IgA-targeted taxa included multiple Firmicutes species. Post-FMT IgA-targeting was unaffected by the route of FMT delivery (colonoscopy versus capsule), suggesting that both methods lead to the establishment of healthy immune–bacterial interactions in the gut. Interestingly, IgA-targeting in FMT recipients closely resembled the IgA-targeting patterns of the donors, and fecal donor identity was significantly associated with IgA-targeting of the recipient microbiota. These data support the concept that intrinsic bacterial properties drive IgA recognition across genetically distinct human hosts. Together, this study suggests that IgA-bacterial interactions are reestablished in human FMT recipients to resemble that of the healthy fecal donor.",2020-12-31,"Huus, Kelsey E; Frankowski, Marcin; Pučić-Baković, Maja; Vučković, Frano; Lauc, Gordan; Mullish, Benjamin H; Marchesi, Julian R; Monaghan, Tanya M; Kao, Dina; Finlay, B.

However, there is a lack of early signs suggesting right ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction prior to acute cor pulmonale development. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analytical cohort study of patients for acute respiratory distress syndrome undertaking an echocardiography during admission in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit. Patients were divided according to treatment: conventional protective ventilation (38 patients, 38%); interventional lung assist (23 patients, 23%); veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (37 patients, 37%). Systolic and diastolic function was studied assessing, respectively: right ventricular systolic longitudinal function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) and systolic contraction duration (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length); right ventricular diastolic filling time and right ventricular diastolic restrictive pattern (presence of pulmonary valve presystolic ejection wave). Correlation between the respiratory mechanics and systo-diastolic parameters were analysed. RESULTS: In 98 patients studied, systolic dysfunction (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <16 mm) was present in 33.6% while diastolic restrictive pattern was present in 64%. A negative correlation was found between tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length (P<0.0001; r −0.42). Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length correlated with right ventricular diastolic filling time (P<0.001; r −0.39). Pulmonary valve presystolic ejection wave was associated with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (P<0.0001), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length (P<0.0001), right ventricular diastolic filling time (P<0.0001), positive end-expiratory pressure (P<0.0001) and peak inspiratory pressure (P<0.0001).

In this article, we report a post hoc analysis of a prospective, single-center cohort study, including 447 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Arachidonic acid (AA)- or adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet-fibrin clot strength (MA(AA) or MA(ADP)) was indicative of the net residual platelet reactivity after the treatment with aspirin or clopidogrel, respectively. AA% or ADP% was indices of the relative platelet inhibition rate on AA or ADP pathway. We found that each parameter alone was predictive of the risk of 6-month ischemic event, even after adjusting for confounding factors. However, the association between AA% and clinical outcome disappeared when further adjusted for MA(AA). Likewise, inclusion of MA(ADP) changed the significant relation between ADP% and clinical outcome. MA(ADP) > 47.0 mm and MA(AA) > 15.1 mm were identified as the optimal cutoffs by receiver operating characteristic analysis. High MA(AA) (HR = 3.963; 95% CI: 1.152–13.632; P = 0.029) and high MA(ADP) (HR = 5.185; 95% CI: 2.228–12.062; P < 0.001) were independent predictors when both were included in multivariable Cox regression hazards model. Interestingly, an even higher risk was found for the coexisting high MA(AA) and high MA(ADP) (HR = 7.870; 95% CI: 3.462–17.899; P < 0.001).

However, we lack a detailed understanding of the drought stress response of microbial decomposers. Here we present metatranscriptomic and metabolomic data on the physiological response of in situ microbial communities on plant litter to long-term drought in Californian grass and shrub ecosystems. We hypothesised that drought causes greater microbial allocation to stress tolerance relative to growth pathways. In grass litter, communities from the decade-long ambient and reduced precipitation treatments had distinct taxonomic and functional profiles. The most discernable physiological signatures of drought were production or uptake of compatible solutes to maintain cellular osmotic balance, and synthesis of capsular and extracellular polymeric substances as a mechanism to retain water. The results show a clear functional response to drought in grass litter communities with greater allocation to survival relative to growth that could affect decomposition under drought. In contrast, communities on chemically more diverse and complex shrub litter had smaller physiological differences in response to long-term drought but higher investment in resource acquisition traits across precipitation treatments, suggesting that the functional response to drought is constrained by substrate quality.

Using CIM6P/IGF2R inhibition in rats and neuron-specific knockdown in mice, here we show that hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R is necessary for hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation, but dispensable for learning, memory retrieval, and reconsolidation. CIM6P/IGF2R controls the training-induced upregulation of de novo protein synthesis, including increase of Arc, Egr1, and c-Fos proteins, without affecting their mRNA induction. Hippocampal or systemic administration of mannose-6-phosphate, like IGF2, significantly enhances memory retention and persistence in a CIM6P/IGF2R-dependent manner.

From a nursing human resources for health (HRH) perspective, there are challenges of low nursing school capacity, high employment of expatriates, labor market fragmentation, shortage of nurses in rural areas, uneven quality, and gender challenges. CASE PRESENTATION: This case study summarizes Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) and Saudi Health Council’s (SHCs) evaluation of the current challenges facing the nursing profession in the KSA. We propose policy interventions to support the transformation of nursing into a profession that contributes to efficient, high-quality healthcare for every Saudi citizen. Key to the success of modernizing the Saudi workforce will be an improved pipeline of nurses that leads from middle and high school to nursing school; followed by a diverse career path that includes postgraduate education. To retain nurses in the profession, there are opportunities to make nursing practice more attractive and family friendly. Interventions include reducing shift length, redesigning the nursing team to add more allied health workers, and introducing locum tenens staffing to balance work-load. There are opportunities to modernize existing nurse postgraduate education, open new postgraduate programs in nursing, and create new positions and career paths for nurses such as telenursing, informatics, and quality.

While vaccines have proven to be the best preventive method to combat the flu, the attitude and knowledge about vaccines are a major hindrance to higher uptake in most of the countries. The yearly coverage, especially in the vulnerable groups in the population, often remains below the herd immunity level despite the Flu Awareness Campaign organized by WHO every year worldwide. This brings immense challenges to the nation’s public health protection agency for strategic decision-making in controlling the flu outbreak every year. To understand the impact of public perceptions and vaccination decisions while designing optimal immunization policy, we model the individual decision-making as a two-strategy pairwise contest game, where pay-off is considered as a function of public health effort for the campaign. We use Pontryagin’s maximum principle to identify the best possible strategy for public health to implement vaccination and reduce infection at a minimum cost. Our optimal analysis shows that the cost of public health initiatives is qualitatively and quantitatively different under different public perceptions and attitudes towards vaccinations. When individual risk perception evolves with vaccine uptake or disease induced death, our model demonstrates a feed-forward mechanism in the dynamics of vaccination and exhibits an increase in vaccine uptake. Using numerical simulation, we also observe that the optimal cost can be minimized by putting the effort in the beginning and later part of the outbreak rather than during the peak. It confers that public health efforts towards disseminating disease severity or actual vaccination risk might accelerate the vaccination coverage and mitigate the infection faster.",2020-10-16,"Deka, Aniruddha; Pantha, Buddhi; Bhattacharyya, Samit",Bull Math Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/cec5eddade2045e57064316d68a86b552175cd8f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7563916.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7563916/,

In addition, the isobutanol production by the parental strain (JCL16) and the high isobutanol-tolerant mutant (SA481) were compared with JCL260. Interestingly, we found that the isobutanol-tolerant strain in fact produced worse than either JCL16 or JCL260.

CBD binds at a novel site at the interface of the fenestrations and the central hydrophobic cavity of the channel. Binding at this site blocks the transmembrane-spanning sodium ion translocation pathway, providing a molecular mechanism for channel inhibition. Modelling studies suggest why the closely-related psychoactive compound tetrahydrocannabinol may not have the same effects on these channels.

H9N2 influenza virus, a low pathogenic avian influenza viruses’ subtype, has become endemic in different types of domestic poultry in lots of countries, resulting in great economic loss due to reduced egg production or high mortality associated with coinfection with other pathogens. These two pathogens are easily mixed with other pathogens to aggravate the disease, and often cause mixed infection in clinics. Co-infection of C. psittaci with H9N2 commonly induces severe pneumonia and high mortality in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. According to previous studies, we postulated that C. psittaci infection may beneficial for the replication of H9N2 in HD11. Consequently, in this study, we clarify the pathogenic mechanism of coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 in the chicken macrophage cell line HD11, which is the first study of the coinfection of C. psittaci and H9N2 in vitro. ABSTRACT: In a pilot study, simultaneous infection with Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci) and H9N2 virus induced 20% mortality and severe avian airsacculitis, shedding light on animal models of poultry respiratory diseases. However, the pathogenesis is still unclear. In the current study, we hypothesized that C. psittaci infection execrates macrophage function and facilitates H9N2 infection. To explore the potential mechanism, we studied the effect of C. psittaci and H9N2 on the functions of HD11 cells in vitro by simultaneous infection of C. psittaci and H9N2. At the same time, we used infection with C. psittaci or H9N2 alone as the control groups. The results showed that coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could significantly aggravate the mortality of HD11 cells compared to C. psittaci or H9N2 infection alone. In addition, coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 did not induce high C. psittaci loads compared to C. psittaci infection alone at 12- and 24-hours post-inoculation (hpi), but coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could increase the loads of H9N2 compared to H9N2 alone in HD11 cells at 12 hpi. More importantly, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression levels, enzyme activity, nitric oxide (NO) production, and phagocytosis were reduced significantly in the group with C. psittaci and H9N2 coinfection compared to those of H9N2 or C. psittaci alone at 24 hpi. Finally, C. psittaci infection induced robust expressions of type Th2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, while interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) displayed a significant decrease compared to H9N2 infection alone at 24 hpi. All the above data indicate that C. psittaci infection can facilitate H9N2 invasion and to aggravate severe avian airsacculitis by impairing macrophage functions.",2020-04-21,"Chu, Jun; Guo, Yongxia; Xu, Guanlong; Zhang, Qiang; Zuo, Zonghui; Li, Qiang; Wang, Yihui; He, Cheng",Animals (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1276f1f121a44ed98a0217e53d0bb4a0fadf8ee0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222846.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222846/,

Prolonged loneliness in young adulthood is a risk factor for concurrent and future mental health problems and attrition, making college a critical time for support. Cognitive and behavioral interventions show promise for decreasing loneliness and can be widely disseminated through technology. OBJECTIVE: This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the initial efficacy, feasibility, and desirability of a smartphone app, Nod, designed to deliver cognitive and behavioral skill-building exercises to reduce loneliness during the transition to college. METHODS: First-year college students (N=221, mean age 18.7 years, 59% female) were recruited online during incoming student orientation, and randomized to either receive immediate access to Nod (experimental group, n=100) or access after 4 weeks (control group, n=121). The app delivered skills via fully automated (1) “social challenges,” suggested activities designed to build social connections; (2) reflections, brief cognitive reframing exercises; and (3) student testimonials that encouraged a growth mindset toward social connection building. Main intention-to-treat analyses were used to compare the conditions on self-assessed loneliness, depressive symptoms, and other mental health and college adjustment outcomes at week 4, controlling for baseline values on those variables. Analyses were also performed to test the hypothesis that the treatment benefits would be particularly pronounced for participants with heightened psychological vulnerability at baseline (ie, higher baseline depressive symptoms and loneliness). RESULTS: Retention was 97% at week 4, and participants viewed an average 36.7 pages of app content. There were no significant condition differences in loneliness at week 4 (F(1, 211)=0.05, P=.82; η(p)(2) <.001). However, there was a significant condition-by-baseline depression interaction to predict week-4 loneliness (F(1,209)=9.65, P=.002; η(p)(2) =.04). Simple slope analyses indicated that baseline depression positively predicted week-4 loneliness among control participants (r=0.30, t(209)=3.81, P<.001), but not among experimental participants (r=–0.09, t(209)=–0.84, P=.40), suggesting that Nod buffered participants with high baseline depression scores from experiencing heightened midquarter loneliness. Similarly, there were no significant condition differences in other week-4 outcomes. However, moderation by baseline vulnerability was found for week-4 depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and indices of college adjustment (eg, perceived social support and campus belonging). CONCLUSIONS: Although Nod exposure did not impact outcomes for the full sample, these results provide initial evidence of its benefit for vulnerable students. The results of this trial suggest that cognitive and behavioral skills delivered via a mobile app can buffer psychologically vulnerable college students against heightened loneliness and depressive symptoms, as well as other negative college adjustment outcomes. Future work will aim to improve upon app engagement, and to address loneliness among other key populations.

Despite the adjunct of ECMO for patients with severe ARDS, they often have prolonged mechanical ventilation and are subject to many of its inherent complications. Here, we describe patients who were cannulated for venovenous (VV) ECMO and were taken off positive pressure ventilation. Methods: This is a primary analysis of patients admitted at a tertiary medical center between the dates of August 2014 to January 2020 who were cannulated to ECMO for refractory respiratory failure. We included all patients ≥18 years old. Patients who were extubated or had a tracheostomy and taken off positive pressure while on ECMO were classified as “off positive pressure ventilation (PPV)” and were compared to patients who remained “on PPV” while on ECMO. Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were ventilator free days at 30 days and 60 days after ECMO cannulation, time from cannulation to date of first out-of-bed (OOB), and hospital length of stay (LOS). Patient characteristics were derived from routine clinical information in the electronic health record (EHR). Categorical characteristics were compared using chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Continuous characteristics were compared using independent samples t-test or Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test. p-values were reported from all analysis. Results: Sixty-five patients were included in this retrospective analysis. Forty-eight were managed on ECMO with PPV and 17 patients were removed from PPV. Patients removed from PPV had significantly higher lung injury scores prior to cannulation (2.5 ± 0.6 vs. 1.04 ± 0.3; p = 0.031) and non-significantly longer duration of ventilation prior to ECMO (6.1 days ± 2.1 vs. 5.0 days ± 01.1; p = 0.634). One hundred percent (100%) of patients removed from PPV survived to hospital discharge compared to 45% who received PPV throughout their duration of ECMO management (p < 0.001). The mean ventilator free days at day 60 was 15 with PPV and 36 without PPV (p = 0.003). The average duration from cannulation to mobilization (i.e., out-of-bed) was 18 days with PPV and 7 days without PPV (p = 0.015). Conclusions: Patients taken off PPV while on ECMO had a very high likelihood of survival to discharge and were mobilized in half as many days. While this likely reflects patient selection, the benefit of early mobilization is well documented and the approach of extubating while on ECMO warrants further investigation.",2021-01-12,"Levin, Nicholas M; Ciullo, Anna L; Overton, Sean; Mitchell, Nathan; Skidmore, Chloe R; Tonna, Joseph E",J Clin Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f92f7f1d9559c2caa6b9088e59a2065da0f39d8f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7827358.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7827358/,

That is the main question behind this psychological study. Based on a working model of compassionate love (Underwood 2008), the priestly compassionate love model was tested to determine whether spirituality, social support, priestly commitment, and well-being simultaneously influence compassionate love, which in turn brings out a positive affect in those doing pastoral ministry. The participants were 256 Catholic priests in Indonesia. Using structural equation modeling, the results of the study showed a good fit. Spirituality was the factor that contributed most strongly to compassionate love. Receiving adequate support from multiple sources motivated the priests to love others. Moreover, priestly commitment also influenced the priests to love others compassionately. Although well-being did not significantly influence compassionate love, it still played an important role in the model because it was correlated with all factors. Finally, the results showed that compassionate love powerfully influenced the priests to be enthusiastic and eager in doing pastoral ministry. These findings are discussed theoretically and practically in the context of priestly life and ministry in Indonesia.

The introduction of antimicrobial chemotherapy in the 1940s led to the rapid abandonment of many forms of passive antibody therapy. Chemotherapy was more effective and less toxic than antibody therapy. In this last decade of the 20th century the efficacy of antimicrobial chemotherapy is diminishing because of the rapidly escalating number of immunocompromised individuals, the emergence of new pathogens, the reemergence of old pathogens, and widespread development of resistance to antimicrobial drugs. This diminishment in the effectiveness of chemotherapy has been paralleled by advances in monoclonal antibody technology that have made feasible the generation of human antibodies. This combination of factors makes passive antibody therapy an option worthy of serious consideration. We propose that for every pathogen there exists an antibody that will modify the infection to the benefit of the host. Such antibodies are potential antimicrobial agents. Antibody-based therapies have significant advantages and disadvantages relative to standard chemotherapy. The reintroduction of antibody-based therapy would require major changes in the practices of infectious disease specialists.",1995-07-03,"Casadevall, Arturo; Scharff, Matthew D.",Clin Infect Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/af4043d17d0033fd6c0d4dd9107beb5a5aba4efd.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197598/,

It has not been tested in the most common PH groups; 2 (left heart disease), 3 (lung disease), or 5 (other disorders). Further it has not been evaluated in the UK National Health Service (NHS) out-patient setting, or with long-term follow-up. The aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a supervised exercise rehabilitation intervention with psychosocial support compared to best practice usual care for people with PH in the community/outpatient setting. METHODS: This multi-centre, pragmatic, two-arm RCT with embedded process evaluation aims to recruit 352 clinically stable adults with PH (groups 1–5) and WHO functional class II-IV. Participants will be randomised to either the Supervised Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise Rehabilitation (SPHERe) intervention or control. The SPHERe intervention consists of 1) individual assessment and familiarisation sessions; 2) 8-week, twice-weekly, supervised out-patient exercise training; 3) psychosocial/motivational support and education; 4) guided home exercise plan. The control intervention consists of best practice usual care with a single one-to-one practitioner appointment, and general advice on physical activity. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 4 months (post-intervention) and 12 months by researchers blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome is the incremental shuttle walk test at 4 months. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life (HRQoL), time to clinical worsening and health and social care use. A purposive sample of participants (n = 20 intervention and n = 20 control) and practitioners (n = 20) will be interviewed to explore experiences of the trial, outcomes and interventions. DISCUSSION: The SPHERe study is the first multi-centre clinical RCT to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of a supervised exercise rehabilitation intervention compared to usual care, delivered in the UK NHS, for people in all PH groups. Results will inform clinicians and commissioners as to whether or not supervised exercise rehabilitation is effective and should be routinely provided for people with PH.

OBJECTIVES: To establish the inter-rater reliability in the quantitative evaluation of spinal cord damage following cervical incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI was used to perform manual measurements of the cranial and caudal boundaries of edema, edema length, midsagittal tissue bridge ratio, axial damage ratio, and edema volume in 10 participants with cervical incomplete SCI. SETTING: Academic university setting. METHODS: Structural MRIs of 10 participants with SCI were collected from Northwestern University’s Neuromuscular Imaging and Research Lab. All manual measures were performed using OsiriX (Pixmeo Sarl, Geneva, Switzerland). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to determine inter-rater reliability across seven raters of varying experience. RESULTS: High-to-excellent inter-rater reliability was found for all measures. ICC values for cranial/caudal levels of involvement, edema length, midsagittal tissue bridge ratio, axial damage ratio, and edema volume were 0.99, 0.98, 0.90, 0.84, and 0.93, respectively.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore perceptions and priorities of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) for physical activity and to incorporate their feedback to inform future development of a physical activity program delivered via a telemonitoring platform. SETTING: New York. METHODS: Qualitative data were collected from a purposive sample of adults with tetraplegia (N = 7). Two investigators led an audio-recorded focus group using a moderator’s guide. Data were analyzed using a six-phase thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: The discussion focused on two major areas, which resulted in multiple derived themes and subthemes. The first theme centered on the daily life of persons with tetraplegia, including changes after SCI, gain of function prioritization, and identification of psychosocial support systems that facilitate community reintegration after injury. The second theme centered on participant perceptions and recommendations for a physical activity program delivered via a telemonitoring platform. Desired design features included variations in schedule, diverse activities, or exercises included in each class, and optional two-way video to enable social interactions with classmates. CONCLUSIONS: Participants favorably viewed the concept of a physical activity program delivered via a telemonitoring platform and contributed program design ideas. Although this was a small sample size, challenges to obtaining physical activity expressed by participants were consistent with those identified previously in larger studies of persons with tetraplegia.

Co-infection can be either viral-viral or viral-bacterial and with new technology there is more information on the role they play on the health of children. RECENT FINDINGS: With the proliferation of multiplex PCR for rapid diagnosis of multiple viruses as well as innovations on identification of bacterial infections, research has been attempting to discover how these co-infections affect each other and the host. Studies are aiming to discern if the epidemiology of viruses seen at a population level is related to the interaction between different viruses on a host level. Studies are also attempting to discover the burden of morbidity and mortality of these viral-viral co-infections on the pediatric population. It is also becoming important to understand the interplay of certain viruses with specific bacteria and understanding the impact of viral-bacterial co-infections. SUMMARY: RSV continues to contribute to a large burden of disease for pediatric patients with acute respiratory illnesses. However, recent literature suggests that viral-viral co-infections do not add to this burden and might, in some cases, be protective of severe disease. Viral-bacterial co-infections, on the other hand, are most likely adding to the burden of morbidity in pediatric patients because of the synergistic way they can infect the nasopharyngeal space. Future research needs to focus on confirming these conclusions as it could affect hospital cohorting, role of molecular testing, and therapeutic interventions.",2020-01-24,"Meskill, Sarah D.; O’Bryant, Shelease C.",Curr Infect Dis Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d18423abd37ecb36b208571cd5d48db4e41434be.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7223550.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223550/,

LLD impacts well-being, with loneliness and small social networks being typical. It has also been linked to cognitive dysfunction and an increased risk of developing dementia. Safety and efficacy of pharmacological treatments for LLD have been debated, and cognitive dysfunction often persists even after remission. Various cognitive interventions have been proposed for LLD. Among these, one has received special attention: foreign language learning could serve as a social intervention that simultaneously targets brain structures affected in LLD. Lifelong bilingualism may significantly delay the onset of cognitive impairment symptoms by boosting cognitive reserve. Even late-life foreign language learning without lifelong bilingualism can train cognitive flexibility. It is then counterintuitive that the effects of language learning on LLD have never been examined. In order to create a theoretical basis for further interdisciplinary research, this paper presents a status quo of current work through two meta-analyses investigating cognitive functioning in LLD on the one hand and in senior bilinguals or seniors following a language course on the other hand.

We previously analyzed Rns sequences from 18 isolates from morphological groups 2 and 3 and found that they fell into four distinct evolutionary lineages we called sequence types T1‐T4. Here, we analyzed sequences from 53 isolates representing 16 species and including 35 new strains. Eight additional lineages (sequence types T5‐T12) were identified. Four of the 12 sequence types included strains from more than one nominal species. Thus, sequence types could be equated with species in some cases or with complexes of closely related species in others. The largest complex, sequence type T4, which contained six closely related nominal species, included 24 of 25 keratitis isolates. Rns sequence variation was insufficient for full phylogenetic resolution of branching orders within this complex, but the mixing of species observed at terminal nodes confirmed that traditional classification of isolates has been inconsistent. One solution to this problem would be to equate sequence types and single species.

However, it is little known about the molecular mechanisms of its antitumor action against osteosarcoma, which is the second highest cause of cancer-related death in children and adolescents. In this study, we investigated the effects of PEITC on K7M2 murine osteosarcoma both in vitro and in vivo. We found that treatment with PEITC dose-dependently inhibited the viability of K7M2 murine osteosarcoma cells with an IC(50) value of 33.49 μM at 24 h. PEITC (1, 15, 30 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the cell proliferation, caused G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, depleted glutathione (GSH), generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), altered iron metabolism, and triggered multiple forms of cell death, namely ferroptosis, apoptosis, and autophagy in K7M2 cells. We further revealed that PEITC treatment activated MAPK signaling pathway, and ROS generation was a major cause of PEITC-induced cell death. In a syngeneic orthotopic osteosarcoma mouse model, administration of PEITC (30, 60 mg/kg every day, ig, for 24 days) significantly inhibited the tumor growth, but higher dose of PEITC (90 mg/kg every day) compromised its anti-osteosarcoma effect. Histological examination showed that multiple cell death processes were initiated, iron metabolism was altered and MAPK signaling pathway was activated in the tumor tissues. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PEITC induces ferroptosis, autophagy, and apoptosis in K7M2 osteosarcoma cells by activating the ROS-related MAPK signaling pathway. PEITC has promising anti-osteosarcoma activity.

METHODS: We undertook an SER to identify primary literature from January 2007 to March 2019 describing health, clinical, reproductive, and psychosocial outcomes resulting from ES/GS in patients with CA/DD/ID. A narrative synthesis of results was performed. RESULTS: We retrieved 2654 publications for full-text review from 7178 articles. Only 167 articles met our inclusion criteria, and these were primarily case reports or small case series of fewer than 20 patients. The most frequently reported outcomes from ES/GS were changes to clinical management or reproductive decision-making.

However, clinician comfort discussing diagnostic errors publicly and barriers to these discussions remain unexplored. We compared clinicians’ comfort discussing diagnostic errors to other medical errors and identified barriers to open discussion. METHODS: Pediatric clinicians at 4 hospitals were surveyed between May and June 2018. The survey assessed respondents’ comfort discussing medical errors (with varying degrees of system versus individual clinician responsibility) during morbidity and mortality conferences and privately with peers. Respondents reported the most significant barriers to discussing diagnostic errors publicly. Poststratification weighting accounted for nonresponse bias; the Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment was applied to control for false discovery (significance set at P < 0.018). RESULTS: Clinicians (n = 838; response rate 22.6%) were significantly less comfortable discussing all error types during morbidity and mortality conferences than privately (P < 0.004) and significantly less comfortable discussing diagnostic errors compared with other medical errors (P < 0.018). Comfort did not differ by clinician type or years in practice; clinicians at one institution were significantly less comfortable discussing diagnostic errors compared with peers at other institutions. The most frequently cited barriers to discussing diagnostic errors publicly included feeling like a bad clinician, loss of reputation, and peer judgment of knowledge base and decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians are more uncomfortable discussing diagnostic errors than other types of medical errors. The most frequent barriers involve the public perception of clinical performance.

However, despite the use of prophylactic antibiotics, neutropenic fever (NF) and hospital readmissions continue to pose as the most important limitations in the outpatient setting. It is possible that the febrile episodes may have a non-infectious etiology, and engraftment syndrome could play a more significant role. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of both G-CSF withdrawal and the addition of primary prophylaxis with corticosteroids after ASCT. METHODS: Between January 2002 and August 2018, 111 MM patients conditioned with melphalan were managed at-home beginning +1 day after ASCT. Three groups were established: Group A (n = 33) received standard G-CSF post-ASCT; group B (n = 32) avoided G-CSF post-ASCT; group C (n = 46) avoided G-CSF yet added corticosteroid prophylaxis post-ASCT. RESULTS: The incidence of NF among the groups was reduced (64%, 44%, and 24%; P<0.001), with a non-significant decrease in hospital readmissions as well (12%, 6%, and 2%; P = 0.07). The most important variables identified for NF were: HCT-CI >2 (OR 6.1; P = 0.002) and G-CSF avoidance plus corticosteroids (OR 0.1; P<0.001); and for hospital readmission: age ≥60 years (OR 14.6; P = 0.04) and G-CSF avoidance plus corticosteroids (OR 0.07; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF avoidance and corticosteroid prophylaxis post ASCT minimize the incidence of NF in MM patients undergoing at-home ASCT.

Immaturity of the follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), in particular, appears to play a critical role for the inability to stimulate immune responses. Using the CD21mT/mG mouse model we found that at 7 days of life, FDCs exhibited a mature phenotype only in the Peyer´s patches (PP), but our unique adjuvant, CTA1-DD, effectively matured FDCs also in peripheral lymph nodes following systemic, as well as mucosal immunizations. This was a direct effect of complement receptor 2-binding to the FDC and a CTA1-enzyme-dependent enhancing effect on gene transcription, among which CR2, IL-6, ICAM-1, IL-1β, and CXCL13 encoding genes were upregulated. This way we achieved FDC maturation, increased germinal center B-cell- and Tfh responses, and enhanced specific antibody levels close to adult magnitudes. Oral priming immunization of neonates against influenza infection with CTA1-3M2e-DD effectively promoted anti-M2e-immunity and significantly reduced morbidity against a live virus challenge infection.

To enhance these responses, there has been renewed emphasis in developing effective cancer-specific vaccines to stimulate and direct T cell immunity to important oncologic targets, such as the oncogene human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), expressed in ~20% of breast cancers (BCs). METHODS: In our study, we explored the use of alternative antigen trafficking through use of a lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP) domain to enhance vaccine efficacy against HER2 and other model antigens in both in vitro and in vivo studies. RESULTS: We found that inclusion of this domain in plasmid vaccines effectively trafficked antigens to endolysosomal compartments, resulting in enhanced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II presentation. Additionally, this augmented the expansion/activation of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and also led to elevated levels of antigen-specific polyfunctional CD8+ T cells. Significantly, vaccination with HER2-LAMP produced tumor regression in ~30% of vaccinated mice with established tumors in an endogenous model of metastatic HER2+ BC, compared with 0% of HER2-WT vaccinated mice. This therapeutic benefit is associated with enhanced tumor infiltration of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

These vesicles encompass many bio-molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids that are transported between cells and regulate pathophysiological actions in the recipient cell. Exosomes originate from multivesicular bodies inside cells and microvesicles shed from the plasma membrane and participate in various pathological conditions. Retroviruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus -type 1 (HIV-1) and Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-1 engage exosomes for spreading and infection. Exosomes from virus-infected cells transfer viral components such as miRNAs and proteins that promote infection and inflammation. Additionally, these exosomes deliver virus receptors to target cells that make them susceptible to virus entry. HIV-1 infected cells release exosomes that contribute to the pathogenesis including neurological disorders and malignancy. Exosomes can also potentially carry out as a modern approach for the development of HIV-1 and HTLV-1 vaccines. Furthermore, as exosomes are present in most biological fluids, they hold the supreme capacity for clinical usage in the early diagnosis and prognosis of viral infection and associated diseases.

Here, we reveal independent emergent behaviour in CTL populations attacking tumour masses. Primary murine CTLs coordinate their migration in a process reminiscent of the swarming observed in neutrophils. CTLs engaging cognate targets accelerate the recruitment of distant T cells through long-range homotypic signalling, in part mediated via the diffusion of chemokines CCL3 and CCL4. Newly arriving CTLs augment the chemotactic signal, further accelerating mass recruitment in a positive feedback loop. Activated effector human T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells similarly employ intra-population signalling to drive rapid convergence.

Three nurses from the hospital coordination team of Saint-Etienne University Hospital, obtained consent for research and transplantation in parallel, screening all intra-hospital deaths cases, following standard protocol to check no refusal from families, despite the French opt-out system. They contacted 127 families for research and 244 for transplantation, in 71% of cases by telephone. Consent was obtained in 62% of cases for research and 54% for transplantation (P = 0.135). The main contraindication for transplantation was the cognitive disorders (66%) followed by the blood cancers (8%). This new specific activity, providing new source of fresh corneas for research immediately usable without any eyebank storage steps, didn’t reduce the number of corneas procured for transplantation versus previous years (P = 0.998). Donors in the research group were 10 years older (P<0.001) without difference regarding endothelial cell quality (P = 0.071), allowing maximal clinical relevance for protocols using these fresh human scientific corneas provided by targeted donation.",2020-05-21,"Garcin, Thibaud; Pugniet, Jean Loup; Peyragrosse, Thierry; Rogues, Francoise; Acquart, Sophie; Cognasse, Fabrice; Thuret, Gilles; Gain, Philippe",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/cdebde80a9844c7528d27ad38d17eca70141b86a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7241724.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7241724/,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred five neurologists and nurses from 30 Italian multiple sclerosis centres were involved in an online quali-quantitative survey on the organization of care, combined with the Satisfaction and Compassion Fatigue Test and a collection of narratives. Descriptive statistics of the quantitative data were integrated with the results obtained by the narrative medicine methods of analysis. RESULTS: Most of the practitioners were neurologists, 46 average years old, 69% women, 43% part time dedicated to multiple sclerosis. An increased number of patients in the last 3 years were referred in 29 centres. Differences were found between neurologists and nurses. Physicians showed higher risks of burnout, reporting intensive working paces, lack of medical personnel, and anxiety caused by the precarious employment conditions. Nurses appeared more satisfied, although the reference to the lack of spaces, and the cross professional roles risk of compassion fatigue. Both positive and negative relationships of care were depicted as influencing the professional quality of life. CONCLUSION: The interviewed neurological teams need to limit the risk of compassion fatigue, which appeared from the first years of the career. The prevalence of the risk among neurologists suggests more awareness among scientific societies and health care managers on the risk for this category, as first step to prevent it.

The clinical outcomes are also not satisfactory. Full-endoscopic decompression of the lumbar spinal canal has achieved satisfactory results for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. This surgery may be used for the treatment of thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) under local anesthesia. The aim of our study is to introduce the surgical techniques used for full-endoscopic decompression for thoracic OLF and to evaluate its safety and efficacy. METHODS: Fourteen patients with thoracic OLF (4 combined with dural ossification) underwent full-endoscopic decompression surgery. An interlaminar approach was performed. The anchoring method was used to establish the working passage. Spinal cord exposure began at a space between the ossification and the spinal cord, and dorsal and contralateral decompression were performed with the “Over the Top” technique. The modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score (11 points) was used to evaluate the efficacy during follow-up. At the same time, the visual analogue scale score for assessing back pain before and after the operation was evaluated. RESULTS: The average operation time was 159.73 ± 62.09 minutes, and the hospitalization time was 7.43 ± 1.79 days. The follow-up period ranged from 8 to 22 months. Neurological function was improved. There were no serious complications. Dural tears occurred in 5 patients, intraoperative neurological deterioration occurred in 1 patient, and intraoperative headache and neck pain occurred in 1 patient.

We observed that more than 4000 host genes were differentially regulated during the study period, which included up regulation of genes encoding proteins, having a role in the innate antiviral immune responses, immune activation, cellular metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis, as well as down regulation of genes involved in mitosis and cell proliferation. Further analysis of RNA-Seq data coupled with RT-qPCR validation collectively showed that double-strand RNA recognition pathways, including retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), were substantially activated following IBV infection.

In order to achieve label-free detection with the sub-100 nm-thick lipid multilayer grating lines, the binding affinity was improved by varying the lipid composition. A colorimetric image analysis of the light diffracted from the gratings using a color camera was then used to identify the grating nanostructures that lead to an optimal signal.

During the past three decades, use of BAL specimens has stimulated immunologic and cellular research of pulmonary diseases, which has provided significant insight into local host immunity, inflammation, fibrogenesis, asthma mechanisms, and infections. From this research new methods of antifibrotic therapy of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, for example, have followed. Moreover, BAL applications have greatly enhanced professional interest in the field of pulmonary medicine. This review attempts to analyze the history and impact of BAL, appraise its current status, and assess its future usefulness. Understanding the immunopathogenesis of many lung diseases is predicated on obtaining in situ specimens from affected lung tissue and airways. BAL provides a direct sample that can be compared with an endobronchial or transbronchial biopsy tissue specimen and with cellular and immunologic components in the vascular circulation. Thus, the recovery of BAL fluid and its components involved directly with a disease process or continguous with interstitial tissue permits a much more detailed assessment of new cellular mediators and cytokines participating in the pathologic process.

Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a class III histone deacetylase, has been shown to play an important role in neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia. In this study, we investigated whether CAG protected against ischemic brain injury and, if so, whether the beneficial effects were associated with the regulation of SIRT1 in the ischemic brain. Mice were subjected to 45 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. CAG (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally at the onset of reperfusion, 12 h later and then twice daily for up to three days. CAG dose-dependently reduced brain infarct volume, significantly ameliorated functional deficits, and prevented neuronal cell loss in MCAO mice. Meanwhile, CAG significantly reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, prevented tight junction degradation and subsequently ameliorated blood-brain barrier disruption. Moreover, CAG significantly upregulated SIRT1 expression in the ischemic brain but did not directly activate its enzymatic activity. Concomitant with SIRT1 upregulation, CAG reduced p53 acetylation and the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 in the ischemic brain. CAG also inhibited NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. As a result, CAG suppressed the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β, and inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the ischemic brain. Our findings suggest that CAG is neuroprotective against ischemic brain injury in mice and that its beneficial effect may involve SIRT1 upregulation and the inhibition of apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the ischemic brain.",2020-03-16,"Li, Man; Li, Shi-chun; Dou, Bao-kai; Zou, Ying-xiang; Han, Hao-zhen; Liu, Dong-xiang; Ke, Zun-ji; Wang, Zhi-fei",Acta Pharmacol Sin,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/614bde001da4b04d6dc58123b5719ab30ab8201e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7471431.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471431/,

We examined the “metavirome” of four populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected in 2016 to 2017 in Manatee County, FL. Unexpectedly, we discovered that dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV4) was circulating in these mosquito populations, representing the first documented case of such a phenomenon in the absence of a local DENV4 human case in this county over a 2-year period. We confirmed that all of the mosquito populations carried the same DENV4 strain, assembled its full genome, validated infection orthogonally by reverse transcriptase PCR, traced the virus origin, estimated the time period of its introduction to the Caribbean region, and explored the viral genetic signatures and mosquito-specific virome associations that potentially mediated DENV4 persistence in mosquitoes. We discuss the significance of prolonged maintenance of the DENV4 infections in A. aegypti that occurred in the absence of a DENV4 human index case in Manatee County with respect to the inability of current surveillance paradigms to detect mosquito vector infections prior to a potential local outbreak. IMPORTANCE Since 1999, dengue outbreaks in the continental United States involving local transmission have occurred only episodically and only in Florida and Texas. In Florida, these episodes appear to be coincident with increased introductions of dengue virus into the region through human travel and migration from countries where the disease is endemic. To date, the U.S. public health response to dengue outbreaks has been largely reactive, and implementation of comprehensive arbovirus surveillance in advance of predictable transmission seasons, which would enable proactive preventative efforts, remains unsupported. The significance of our finding is that it is the first documented report of DENV4 transmission to and maintenance within a local mosquito vector population in the continental United States in the absence of a human case during two consecutive years. Our data suggest that molecular surveillance of mosquito populations in high-risk, high-tourism areas of the United States may enable proactive, targeted vector control before potential arbovirus outbreaks.",2020-04-29,"Boyles, Sean M.; Mavian, Carla N.; Finol, Esteban; Ukhanova, Maria; Stephenson, Caroline J.; Hamerlinck, Gabriela; Kang, Seokyoung; Baumgartner, Caleb; Geesey, Mary; Stinton, Israel; Williams, Katie; Mathias, Derrick K.; Prosperi, Mattia; Mai, Volker; Salemi, Marco; Buckner, Eva A.; Lednicky, John A.; Rivers, Adam R.; Dinglasan, Rhoel R.",mSphere,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9011eb415cf4a9be661570efdfe93dc73dce3d64.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7193045.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193045/,

Methods: this paper is an exploratory explanation of gendered life expectancy difference (GLED) using a novel combination of epidemiological and sociological methods. We present the global picture of GLED. We then utilise a secondary data comparative case analysis offering explanations for GLED in Australia and Ethiopia. We combine a social determinant of health lens with Bourdieu’s concepts of capitals (economic, cultural, symbolic and social). Results: we confirmed continuing GLED in all countries ranging from less than a year to over 11 years. The Australian and Ethiopian cases demonstrated the complex factors underpinning this difference, highlighting similarities and differences in socioeconomic and cultural factors and how they are gendered within and between the countries. Bourdieu’s capitals enabled us to partially explain GLED and to develop a conceptual model of causal pathways.

METHODS: Ninety-two patients and 92 age- and gender-matched healthy controls received adjuvant-free influenza A/California/7/2009 (pH1N1) vaccine. Blood samples were collected immediately before and 3 weeks after vaccination to evaluate antibody responses to the H1N1 virus. Efficacy was assessed by seroprotection (SP) and seroconversion (SC) rates and the factor increase in geometric mean antibody titre. Participants received a 21-day symptom diary card and were instructed to report local and systemic adverse events. RESULTS: SSc patients were predominantly females (91%) and 61% had limited SSc, 12% had severe skin involvement and 57.6% were on immunosuppressive (IS) therapy. SSc patients and controls presented comparable overall SP (P = 0.20) and SC (P = 0.61) rates. Further evaluation of the possible effect of disease and therapy revealed similar rates of SP and SC in patients with dcSSc vs lcSSc (SP P = 0.62 and SC P = 0.66), severe vs mild/moderate skin involvement (SP P = 1 and SC P = 0.45) and with vs without IS (SP P = 0.26 and SC P = 0.10). The frequency of mild local and minor systemic reactions was similar in patients with dcSSC vs lcSSc (P = 0.70 vs 0.32) and in those with and without severe skin involvement (P = 0.59 vs 0.28). CONCLUSION: The non-adjuvanted influenza H1N1 virus vaccine proved to be safe and effective, independent of SSc clinical subtype, disease severity or therapy. These latter factors do not seem to contribute to mild adverse events observed in SSc. Our data support the annual influenza vaccination recommendation for these patients.

We sought to assess the independent association of ARDS with in-hospital mortality among intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. METHODS: We studied two prospective sepsis cohorts drawn from the Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury (EARLI; n = 474) and Validating Acute Lung Injury markers for Diagnosis (VALID; n = 337) cohorts. ARDS was defined by Berlin criteria. We used logistic regression to compare in-hospital mortality in patients with and without ARDS, controlling for baseline severity of illness. We also estimated attributable mortality, adjusted for illness severity by stratification. RESULTS: ARDS occurred in 195 EARLI patients (41%) and 99 VALID patients (29%). ARDS was independently associated with risk of hospital death in multivariate analysis, even after controlling for severity of illness, as measured by APACHE II (odds ratio [OR] 1.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02, 2.67), p = 0.04 in EARLI; OR 2.12 (CI 1.16, 3.92), p = 0.02 in VALID). Patients with severe ARDS (P/F < 100) primarily drove this relationship. The attributable mortality of ARDS was 27% (CI 14%, 37%) in EARLI and 37% (CI 10%, 51%) in VALID. ARDS was independently associated with ICU mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and ventilator-free days. CONCLUSIONS: Development of ARDS among ICU patients with sepsis confers increased risk of ICU and in-hospital mortality in addition to other important outcomes. Clinical trials targeting patients with severe ARDS will be best poised to detect measurable differences in these outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative value placed on different outcomes to be used in a pivotal trial for the upper extremity configuration of the Networked Neuroprosthesis (NNP) as well as the tolerance of the expected adverse event profile. SETTING: Academic medical center in the United States. METHODS: Distribution of an online survey to adults living with tetraplegia; extent of agreement with each question/statement was obtaining using a 1–7 Likert scale. RESULTS: There were 8 statements about potential benefits in arm/hand function; for all statements, more than 70% of participants rated the functions as “1-very important” to regain. There were variable degrees of concern related to risks that could occur during the 30-day post-surgical period and increasing degrees of concern related to risks that could occur in the first 5 years, potentially due to the device, based on the increasing degree of invasiveness of the intervention required to address the event. When analysing the results based on all degrees of interest, more than 64% of responders were interested in getting the NNP with a success rate threshold as low as 50% regardless of time post-injury. Chi-squared analyses revealed some associations between responses and sex, injury level, and injury duration; however, none of these were statistically significant upon post-hoc analysis. CONCLUSION: Data here indicate that people with tetraplegia are highly interested in a range of arm/hand functions and are tolerant of expected risks that may be associated with implanted neuroprosthetics.

Restoration of the injured nerves requires a complex cellular and molecular response to rebuild the functional axons so that they can accurately connect with their original targets. However, there is no optimized therapy for complete recovery after PNI. Supplementation with exogenous growth factors (GFs) is an emerging and versatile therapeutic strategy for promoting nerve regeneration and functional recovery. GFs activate the downstream targets of various signaling cascades through binding with their corresponding receptors to exert their multiple effects on neurorestoration and tissue regeneration. However, the simple administration of GFs is insufficient for reconstructing PNI due to their short half‑life and rapid deactivation in body fluids. To overcome these shortcomings, several nerve conduits derived from biological tissue or synthetic materials have been developed. Their good biocompatibility and biofunctionality made them a suitable vehicle for the delivery of multiple GFs to support peripheral nerve regeneration. After repairing nerve defects, the controlled release of GFs from the conduit structures is able to continuously improve axonal regeneration and functional outcome. Thus, therapies with growth factor (GF) delivery systems have received increasing attention in recent years. Here, we mainly review the therapeutic capacity of GFs and their incorporation into nerve guides for repairing PNI. In addition, the possible receptors and signaling mechanisms of the GF family exerting their biological effects are also emphasized.",2020-03-02,"Li, Rui; Li, Duo-hui; Zhang, Hong-yu; Wang, Jian; Li, Xiao-kun; Xiao, Jian",Acta Pharmacol Sin,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7cb7ba136197109723c08903e95f046d8e904906.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7608263.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608263/,

Such direct anthropogenic emissions are gaining importance, as those from furnishings and building materials have become better regulated and energy efficient homes may reduce ventilation. While previous studies have characterized human emissions in indoor environments, the question remains whether VOCs remain unidentified by current measuring techniques. In this study conducted in a climate chamber occupied by four people, the total OH reactivity of air was quantified, together with multiple VOCs measured by proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) and fast gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (fast-GC–MS). Whole-body, breath, and dermal emissions were assessed. The comparison of directly measured OH reactivity and that of the summed reactivity of individually measured species revealed no significant shortfall. Ozone exposure (37 ppb) was found to have little influence on breath OH reactivity but enhanced dermal OH reactivity significantly. Without ozone, the whole-body OH reactivity was dominated by breath emissions, mostly isoprene (76%). With ozone present, OH reactivity nearly doubled, with the increase being mainly caused by dermal emissions of mostly carbonyl compounds (57%).

Here, we demonstrated that the innate immune responses generated to three distinct ZIKV strains (all isolated from human serum) were significantly different and dependent on their passage history (in mosquito, monkey, or human cells). In addition, some of these phenotypic differences were reduced by a single additional cell culture passage, suggesting that viruses that have been passaged more than 3 times from the patient sample will no longer reflect natural phenotypes. Two of the ZIKV strains analyzed induced high levels of the IP-10 chemokine and IFNγ in human prostate epithelial and stromal mesenchymal stem cells. To further understand the importance of these innate responses on ZIKV replication, we measured the effects of IP-10 and its downstream receptor, CXCR3, on RNA and virus production in prostate cells. Treatment with IP-10, CXCR3 agonist, or CXCR3 antagonist significantly altered ZIKV viral gene expression, depending on their passage in cells of relevant hosts (mosquito or human). We detected differences in gene expression of two primary CXCR3 isoforms (CXCR3-A and CXCR3-B) on the two cell types, possibly explaining differences in viral output. Lastly, we examined the effects of IP-10, agonist, or antagonist on cell death and proliferation under physiologically relevant infection rates, and detected no significant differences.

Hypothesis: Treatment with rFeIFN‐ω in cats with fibrosarcoma is safe and feasible. Animals: Twenty domestic cats. Methods: In an open‐labeled uncontrolled clinical trial 12 injections of 1 × 10(6) U/kg rFeIFN‐ω were administered over a 5‐week period: the 1st through 4th injections were given intratumorally, and the 5th through 12th injections were administered subcutaneously at the tumor excision site.

However, there is very little data on people’s preferences about death determination criteria. We conducted online vignette-based survey with Latvian participants (N = 1416). The data suggest that the pluralist solution fits best with the way our study participants think about death determination—widely differing preferences concerning death determination criteria were observed.

The current study assesses the moderating influence of social support on the association between economic abuse (EA) and economic hardship. Female participants (n = 435) were recruited to participate in a web-based survey which included standardized measures of EA, other forms of IPV, domains of social support, and economic hardship. Analysis included bivariate and multivariate regression with an investigation into interaction effects.Experiencing EA was significantly correlated with economic hardship, even with extent of physical and emotional IPV controlled. Both tangible and appraisal support had significant negative association with extent of material hardship. Significant interactions between forms of social support and economic abuse were observed. For those at high levels of economic abuse, support had less influence on economic hardship. A mix of direct economic aid, advocacy, education and support could provide a blueprint for addressing the economic hardship experiences of community-dwelling survivors of economic abuse. A comprehensive response to EA requires interventions aimed directly at economically controlling and exploitative tactics, including credit building, individual economic advocacy, and education.

This study aimed at determining the perceptions of Canaanland, an emerging urban community in Ogun State, Nigeria, on treated wastewater reuse for several purposes. Data were collected through questionnaires administered to the city residents (n = 244). Findings revealed that the city was aware of the economic and environmental benefits of wastewater reuse but would prefer reuse schemes that involved less human contact such as flushing toilets, electricity generation, building construction, and car wash. The least preferred option was for potable purposes. The community also revealed that they would be willing to accept wastewater reuse as long as it is endorsed by medical doctors, university professors, and experts. However, 45.5% of the respondents were from the Covenant University academic environment. Also, an assessment was carried out to ascertain the implications and opportunities for wastewater reuse in the city. Findings indicated that wastewater reuse involves several complexities and interlinkages, which revolve around political and decisional factors, economic and social factors, environmental factors, and technological factors. From the study, policy and decisional suggestions and a wastewater process flow were developed for more efficient wastewater management within developing cities. A study was carried out on eight cities from developing nations that have created a framework for wastewater management using several approaches. Also, a summary of findings reveals that if adequately researched, cheap and alternative means of wastewater treatment and reuse could be developed for electricity generation, carwash, and firefighting for developing nations.

Previous studies in a number of fungal species have identified the requirement of several signaling pathways for anastomosis, including the so far best characterized soft (So) gene, and the MAPK pathway components MAK-1 and MAK-2 of Neurospora crassa. Despite the observations of hyphal fusions’ involvement in pathogenicity and host adhesion, the connection between cell fusion and fungal lifestyles is still unclear. Here, we address the role of anastomosis in fungal development and asexual reproduction in Zymoseptoria tritici, the most important fungal pathogen of wheat in Europe. RESULTS: We show that Z. tritici undergoes self-fusion between distinct cellular structures, and its mechanism is dependent on the initial cell density. Contrary to other fungi, cell fusion in Z. tritici only resulted in cytoplasmic mixing but not in multinucleated cell formation. The deletion of the So orthologous ZtSof1 disrupted cell-to-cell communication affecting both hyphal and germling fusion. We show that Z. tritici mutants for MAPK-encoding ZtSlt2 (orthologous to MAK-1) and ZtFus3 (orthologous to MAK-2) genes also failed to undergo anastomosis, demonstrating the functional conservation of this signaling mechanism across species. Additionally, the ΔZtSof1 mutant was severely impaired in melanization, suggesting that the So gene function is related to melanization. Finally, we demonstrated that anastomosis is dispensable for pathogenicity, but essential for the pycnidium development, and its absence abolishes the asexual reproduction of Z. tritici. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the role for ZtSof1, ZtSlt2, and ZtFus3 in cell fusions of Z. tritici. Cell fusions are essential for different aspects of the Z. tritici biology, and the ZtSof1 gene is a potential target to control septoria tritici blotch (STB) disease.",2020-08-11,"Francisco, Carolina Sardinha; Zwyssig, Maria Manuela; Palma-Guerrero, Javier",BMC Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ffa7aa820e04becc6ace0322c945d21dcafae4ae.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7477884.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7477884/,

A bacterial strain—which was marked as MB4 and identified by means of 16S rDNA sequencing and physiological characterization as either Bacillus pumilus or Bacillus altitudinis—enhanced the extraction yield of Jatropha oil. The incubation of an MB4 starter culture with preheated kernel slurry in aqueous media with the initial pH of 5.5 at 37 °C for 6 h liberated 73% w/w of the Jatropha oil. Since MB4 produces xylanases, it is suggested that strain MB4 facilitates oil liberation via degradation of hemicelluloses which form the oil-containing cell wall structure of the kernel. After MB4 assisted oil extraction, SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the majority of Jatropha proteins were preserved in the solid phase of the extraction residues. The advantages offered by this process are: protein in the residue can be further processed for other applications, no purified enzyme preparation is needed, and the resulting oil can be used for biodiesel production.",2011-05-10,"Marasabessy, Ahmad; Moeis, Maelita R.; Sanders, Johan P.

This phenomenon is commonly referred to as O(3) adaptation. Whether or not a “state” of adaptation develops due to long-term low level O(3) exposure is unknown. Two human studies have reported adaptation in subjects living in Los Angeles during periods when ambient O(3) concentrations have been relatively high. At present, however, we are not aware of comparable information from rats. This study assessed O(3) adaptation in rats following chronic (12 or 18 months) exposure and after a 4-month recovery period. A chronic exposure pattern, similar to that found in an urban area during the summer (0.06 ppm O(3) for 13 hr/day, 7 days/week; Monday–Friday, peak to 0.25 ppm O(3), over 9 hr), was used. To assess whether adaptation had occurred and/or persisted, awake rats were challenged with high provocative concentrations of O(3) for up to 2 hr. During a challenge, rats were monitored for typical O(3)-induced alterations in spontaneous breathing parameters (e.g., increase in breathing frequency and decrease in tidal volume). Adaptation was defined as attenuation of breathing response during the challenge in rats chronically exposed to O(3) as compared to that in “control” rats (chronically exposed to air). Adaptation was found in the rats within 8 hr following the chronic O(3) exposure but not after the 4-month recovery period. Spontaneous breathing parameters that were significantly attenuated in the chronically exposed rats were breathing frequency, tidal volume, inspiratory and expiratory times, and maximum expiratory flow. We conclude that rats demonstrated adaptation to O(3) after long-term exposure to an urban-type O(3) profile and that the adaptation was not seen 4 months postexpo-sure. These results suggest that exposure to environmental O(3) in Los Angeles air may have been responsible for the adaptation found in residential subjects.",1995-01-03,"WIESTER, M. J.; TEPPER, J.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare but are frequently diagnosed at advanced stages and require systemic therapy. Patients and methods. This multicenter, open-label, phase II study evaluated sunitinib in Japanese patients with well-differentiated pancreatic NET. Patients received sunitinib 37.5 mg/day on a continuous daily dosing (CDD) schedule. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR; percentage of complete responses [CRs] plus partial responses [PRs] plus stable disease [SD] ≥24 weeks). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), tumor shrinkage, progression-free survival (PFS) probability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers. Results. Twelve patients received treatment. The CBR was 75 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 43–94) and included 6 patients with a PR and 3 with SD. The ORR was 50 % (95 % CI, 21–79). PFS probability was 91 % (95 % CI, 54–99) at 6 months and 71 % (95 % CI, 34–90) at 12 months. Commonly reported treatment-emergent (all-causality), any-grade adverse events included diarrhea (n = 10), hand–foot syndrome and hypertension (both n = 8), fatigue and headache (both n = 7), and neutropenia (n = 6). No deaths on study were reported; one death due to disease progression occurred >28 days after end of treatment. Sunitinib on a CDD schedule resulted in sustained drug concentrations without accumulation across cycles. Tumor responses in all 12 patients did not appear to correlate with decreases in chromogranin A levels. Conclusions. Sunitinib 37.5 mg/day on a CDD schedule demonstrated antitumor activity in Japanese patients with unresectable, well-differentiated pancreatic NET. Commonly reported adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of sunitinib.

Many empirically validated psychotherapeutic treatments incorporate elements targeting emotion regulation. Most of these treatment approaches are conceptualized as standard face-to-face treatments not as blended treatments, which include an internet-based intervention. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine, for the first time, a new internet-based intervention—REMOTION—that will be provided transdiagnostically, as an add-on to psychotherapy, to provide a blended treatment format. METHODS: A total of 70 participants will be assigned (1:1 allocation ratio) to either the intervention group (REMOTION + psychotherapy) or the treatment-as-usual group that receives psychotherapy alone. To maximize external validity, a typical outpatient treatment sample of patients diagnosed with a range of disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, and adjustment disorder will be recruited from a university outpatient clinic. Patients with bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, or acute suicidality will be excluded from the study. The feasibility and potential effectiveness of the intervention will be examined by assessing data at baseline, 6 weeks (post), and 12 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome is general symptom severity, assessed with the Brief Symptom Inventory. Secondary outcomes are emotion regulation, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, health related quality of life, well-being, and a variety of feasibility parameters. Quantitative data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Participant recruitment and data collection started in February 2020, and as of November 2020, are ongoing. Results for the study are expected in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot randomized controlled trial will inform future studies using transdiagnostic blended treatment.

Synthetic peptide mutants of NS4A were found to inhibit NS3 function. The bridging from peptide inhibitors to heterocyclic peptidomimetics of NS4A has not been considered in the literature and, therefore, we decided to explore this strategy for developing a new class of NS3 inhibitors. In this report, a structure-based design approach was used to convert the bound form of NS4A into 1H-imidazole-2,5-dicarboxamide derivatives as first generation peptidomimetics. This scaffold mimics the buried amino acid sequence Ile-25` to Arg-28` at the core of NS4A(21`–33`) needed to activate the NS3 protease. Some of the synthesized compounds (Coded MOC) were able to compete with and displace NS4A(21`–33`) for binding to NS3. For instance, N(5)-(4-guanidinobutyl)-N(2)-(n-hexyl)-1H-imidazole-2,5-dicarboxamide (MOC-24) inhibited the binding of NS4A(21`–33`) with a competition half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 1.9 ± 0.12 µM in a fluorescence anisotropy assay and stabilized the denaturation of NS3 by increasing the aggregation temperature (40% compared to NS4A(21`–33`)). MOC-24 also inhibited NS3 protease activity in a fluorometric assay. Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to rationalize the differences in structure–activity relationship (SAR) between the active MOC-24 and the inactive MOC-26. Our data show that MOC compounds are possibly the first examples of NS4A peptidomimetics that have demonstrated promising activities against NS3 proteins.",2020-03-21,"Omar, Abdelsattar M.; Elfaky, Mahmoud A.; Arold, Stefan T.; Soror, Sameh H.; Khayat, Maan T.; Asfour, Hani Z.; Bamane, Faida H.; El-Araby, Moustafa E.",Biomolecules,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ee80518fae300e6cd68a542c6b48dac760b00dc0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175367.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175367/,

METHODS: This was a multi-centre, randomized controlled trial comparing outcomes in trauma patients who received empiric MHPs, augmented by either VHA or CCT-guided interventions. Primary outcome was the proportion of subjects who, at 24 h after injury, were alive and free of massive transfusion (10 or more red cell transfusions). Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality. Pre-specified subgroups included patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). RESULTS: Of 396 patients in the intention to treat analysis, 201 were allocated to VHA and 195 to CCT-guided therapy. At 24 h, there was no difference in the proportion of patients who were alive and free of massive transfusion (VHA: 67%, CCT: 64%, OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.76–1.73). 28-day mortality was not different overall (VHA: 25%, CCT: 28%, OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54–1.31), nor were there differences in other secondary outcomes or serious adverse events.

We matched case patients with ITP to one or two control patients with other diseases by institution, hospital visit timing, sex, and age. We calculated McNemar’s pairwise odds ratios (ORs [95% confidence interval]) with 114 case–control pairs. The case group had 27 (44%) males and 22 (35%) infants, and the control group included 49 (43%) males and 42 (37%) infants. For all age groups, the McNemar’s OR for ITP occurrence was 1.80 (0.54–6.84, p = 0.64) for all vaccines. Among infants, these were 1.50 (0.17–18.0, p = 0.50) for all vaccines, 2.00 (0.29–22.1, p = 0.67) for live vaccines, and 1.00 (0.01–78.5, p = 0.50) for inactivated vaccines.

In this study we investigated whether IgD-Fc-Ig exerted therapeutic effects in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. CIA rats were treated with IgD-Fc-Ig (1, 3, and 9 mg/kg) or injected with biological agents etanercept (3 mg/kg) once every 3 days for 40 days. In the PBMCs and spleen lymphocytes of CIA rats, both T and B cells exhibited abnormal proliferation; the percentages of CD3(+) total T cells, CD3(+)CD4(+) Th cells, CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+)-activated Th cells, Th1(CD4(+)IFN-γ(+)), and Th17(CD4(+)IL-17(+)) were significantly increased, whereas the Treg (CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)) cell percentage was decreased. IgD-Fc-Ig administration dose-dependently decreased the indicators of arthritis; alleviated the histopathology of spleen and joint; reduced serum inflammatory cytokines levels; decreased the percentages of CD3(+) total T cells, CD3(+)CD4(+) Th cells, CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+)-activated Th cells, Th1 (CD4(+)IFN-γ(+)), and Th17(CD4(+)IL-17(+)); increased Treg (CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)) cell percentage; and down-regulated the expression of key molecules in IgD-IgDR-Lck-NF-κB signaling (p-Lck, p-ZAP70, p-P38, p-NF-κB65).

Our aim was to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of telavancin to design optimized dosing regimens for obese patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and varying renal function. METHODS: The PBPK model was verified using clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data of telavancin in healthy populations with varying renal function and obese populations with normal renal function. Then, the PBPK model was applied to predict the PK in obese HAP patients with renal impairment (RI). RESULTS: The fold error values of PK parameters (AUC, C(max), T(max)) were all within 1.5. The telavancin AUC(0-inf) was predicted to increase 1.07-fold in mild RI, 1.23-fold in moderate RI, 1.41-fold in severe RI, and 1.57-fold in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), compared with that in obese HAP with normal renal function. The PBPK model combined with Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) suggested that dose adjustment based on a 750-mg-fixed dose could achieve effectiveness with reduced risk of toxicity, compared with current TBW-based dosing recommendations. CONCLUSION: The PBPK simulation proposed that using TBW-based regimen in obesity with RI should be avoided. Dose recommendations in obesity from the PBPK model are 750 mg daily for normal renal function and mild RI, 610 mg daily for moderate RI, 530 mg daily for severe RI, and 480 mg daily for ESRD.

METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included adult OHCA survivors who underwent hypothermic TTM from December 2011 to December 2019. High HbA1c at admission was defined as a level higher than 6%. Poor neurological outcomes were defined as cerebral performance category scores of 3–5. The primary outcome was 6-month mortality. The secondary outcome was the 6-month neurological outcome. Descriptive statistics, log-rank tests, and multivariable regression modeling were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 302 patients included in the final analysis, 102 patients (33.8%) had HbA1c levels higher than 6%. The high HbA1c group had significantly worse 6-month survival (12.7% vs. 37.5%, p < 0.001) and 6-month outcomes (89.2% vs. 73.0%, p = 0.001) than the non-high HbA1c group.

The virus is believed to have emerged from a reassortment event involving a swine virus some time in the past 10 to 20 years, but pigs, pork, and pork products have not been involved with infection or spread of the virus to or among people. Because countries quickly implemented recently developed pandemic influenza plans, the disease was detected and reported and public health authorities instituted control measures in a timely fashion. But the news media's unfortunate and inappropriate naming of the disease as the “swine flu” led to a drop in the demand for pork and several countries banned pork imports from affected countries, resulting in serious negative economic impacts on the pork industry. With the continual circulation and interspecies transmission of human, swine, and avian influenza viruses in countries around the world, there are calls for strengthening influenza surveillance in pigs, birds, and other animals to aid in monitoring and assessing the risk of future pandemic virus emergence involving different species. We identify and discuss several lessons to be learned from pandemic H1N1 2009 from a One Health perspective, as stronger collaboration among human, animal, and environmental health sectors is necessary to more effectively prevent or detect and respond to influenza pandemics and thus improve human, animal, and environmental health and well-being.",2010-01-01,"Pappaioanou, Marguerite; Gramer, Marie",ILAR J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8f89888401d270722facf576b258a9bc52594dfb.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314042/,

The review included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated and compared the effect of exercise versus usual care on inflammatory parameters in acutely hospitalized older adults. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies. The quality of all the included studies was assessed using the DerSimonian–Laird random-effects inverse-variance model. Five studies (275 participants) met the inclusion criteria. The exercise interventions included resistance or multicomponent intervention programs. The results indicate that, compared with usual care, exercise interventions have a positive impact on overall inflammatory parameters, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) (Hedge’s g = −0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.33 to −0.04, p = 0.011, I(2) = 0%).

The study of bNAbs arising in natural infection is essential in this endeavor. We generated a human antibody, 8D6, recognizing the E2 protein of HCV isolated from a chronic hepatitis C patient. This antibody shows broadly neutralizing activity, which covers a pan-genotypic panel of cell culture-derived HCV virions (HCVcc). Functional and epitope analyses demonstrated that 8D6 can block the interaction between E2 and CD81 by targeting a highly conserved epitope on E2. We describe how the 8D6 lineage evolved via somatic hypermutation to achieve broad neutralization. We found that the V(D)J recombination-generated junctional and somatic hypermutation-induced disulfide bridge (C-C) motif in the CDRH3 is critical for the broad neutralization and binding activity of 8D6. This motif is conserved among a series of broadly neutralizing HCV antibodies, indicating a common binding model. Next, the 8D6 inferred germline (iGL) was reconstructed and tested for its binding affinity and neutralization activity. Interestingly, 8D6 iGL-mediated relatively strong inhibition of the 1b genotype PR79L9 strain, suggesting that PR79L9 may serve as a potential natural viral strain that provides E2 sequences that induce bNAbs. Overall, our detailed epitope mapping and genetic studies of the HCV E2-specific mAb 8D6 have allowed for further refinement of antigenic sites on E2 and reveal a new mechanism to generate a functional CDRH3, while its iGL can serve as a probe to identify potential HCV vaccine strains.",2020-03-31,"Yi, Chunyan; Xia, Jing; He, Lan; Ling, Zhiyang; Wang, Xuesong; Yan, Yu; Wang, Jiangjun; Zhao, Xinhao; Fan, Weiguo; Sun, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Ronghua; Ye, Sheng; Zhang, Rongguang; Xu, Yongfen; Ma, Liyan; Zhang, Yaguang; Zhou, Honglin; Huang, Zhong; Niu, Junqi; Long, Gang; Lu, Junxia; Zhong, Jin; Sun, Bing",Cell Mol Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d88f5e74983640e30e8b5818cc0e2e2a9d3fb692.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222171.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222171/,

However, antibodies induced by the vaccine display differences in their specificity and cross-reactivity dependent on pre-existing immunity. Here, we present a computational model that can capture the effect of pre-existing immunity on influenza vaccine responses. The model predicts the region of the virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein targeted by antibodies after vaccination as well as the level of cross-reactivity induced by the vaccine. We tested our model by simulating a scenario similar to the 2009 pandemic vaccine and compared the results to antibody binding data obtained from human subjects vaccinated with the monovalent 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. RESULTS: We found that both specificity and cross-reactivity of the antibodies induced by the 2009 H1N1 influenza HA protein were affected by the viral strain the individual was originally exposed. Specifically, the level of antigenic relatedness between the original exposure HA antigen and the 2009 HA protein affected antigenic-site immunodominance. Moreover, antibody cross-reactivity was increased when the individual’s pre-existing immunity was specific to an HA protein antigenically distinct from the 2009 pandemic strain. Comparison of simulation data with antibody binding data from human serum samples demonstrated qualitative and quantitative similarities between the model and real-life immune responses to the 2009 vaccine. CONCLUSION: We provide a novel method to evaluate expected outcomes in antibody specificity and cross-reactivity after influenza vaccination in individuals with different influenza HA antigen exposure histories.

Current studies concerning AMR have mainly focused on the diagnostic value of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-type donor-specific antihuman leukocyte antigen antibodies (DSAs), primarily because of their antigen specificity, whereas the clinical significance of immunoglobulin M (IgM)-type DSAs has not been thoroughly investigated in the context of organ transplantation because of their nonspecificity against antigens. Although consensus regarding the clinical significance and role of IgM antibodies is not clear, as discussed in this review, recent findings strongly suggest that they also have a huge potential in novel diagnostic as well as therapeutic application for the prevention of AMR. Most serum IgM antibodies are known to comprise natural antibodies with low affinity toward antigens, and this is derived from B-1 cells (innate B cells). However, some of the serum IgM-type antibodies reportedly also produced by B-2 cells (conventional B cells). The latter are known to have a high affinity for donor-specific antigens. In this review, we initially discuss how IgM-type antibodies of different origins participate in the pathology of various diseases, directly or through cell surface receptors, complement activation, or cytokine production.

Resorption is accomplished by osteoclasts and their generation may depend on an interaction with the cells in direct contact with the root, the cementoblasts. Our study aimed to investigate the role of human cementoblasts in the formation of osteoclasts and the effect of interleukin (IL)-1β hereupon. Extracted teeth from healthy volunteers were subjected to sequential digestion by type I collagenase and trypsin. The effect of enzymatic digestion on the presence of cells on the root surface was analyzed by histology. Gene expression of primary human cementoblasts (pHCB) was compared with a human cementoblast cell line (HCEM). The pHCBs were analyzed for their expression of IL-1 receptors as well as of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). In a co-culture system consisting of osteoclast precursors (blood monocytes) and pHCBs, the formation of osteoclasts and their resorptive activity was assessed by osteo-assay and ivory slices. The cells obtained after a 120 min enzyme digestion expressed the highest level of bone sialoprotein, similar to that of HCEM. This fraction of isolated cells also shared a similar expression pattern of IL-1 receptors (IL1-R1 and IL1-R2). Treatment with IL-1β potently upregulated RANKL expression but not of OPG. pHCBs were shown to induce the formation of functional osteoclasts. This capacity was significantly stimulated by pretreating the pHCBs with IL-1β prior to their co-culture with human blood monocytes. Our study demonstrated that cementoblasts have the capacity to induce osteoclastogenesis, a capacity strongly promoted by IL-1β.

However, it is difficult to affirm the existence of definite evidence of such a benefit. In this article, we discuss the effects of low-intensity short-duration exercise on cell-mediated immunity, and contrast them to the effects of high-intensity and long-duration exercise. Whereas high-intensity exercise induces inflammation and reduces cell-mediated immune system function, low-intensity exercise does not appear to have a large effect on either inflammation or cell-mediated immune function. Low-intensity exercises such as walking and yoga, which are helpful to relieve stress, cannot be considered as harmful to the immune system. Although yoga was shown to impose fewer restrictions on breathing and physical strain, the evidence that yoga enhances cell-mediated immunity remains insufficient.

These progenitor cells were first discovered as bone marrow-derived adult multipotent cells and believed to migrate to sites of injury, opposing the notion that they are residents of all tissue types. In recent years, however, it has been demonstrated that MSC can be found in all tissues and MSC from different tissues represent distinct populations with differential protein expression unique to each tissue type. Importantly, these cells are efficient mediators of tissue repair, regeneration, and prove to be targets for therapeutics, demonstrated by clinical trials (phase 1–4) for MSC-derived therapies for diseases like graft-versus-host-disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn’s disease. The tissue-resident status of MSC found in the lung is a key feature of their importance in the context of disease and injuries of the respiratory system, since these cells could be instrumental to providing more specific and targeted therapies. Currently, bone marrow-derived MSC have been established in the treatment of disease, including diseases of the lung. However, with lung-resident MSC representing a unique population with a different phenotypic and gene expression pattern than MSC derived from other tissues, their role in remediating lung inflammation and injury could provide enhanced efficacy over bone marrow-derived MSC methods.

This trial aimed at assessing the impact of early mechanical ventilation (EMV) on pneumonia occurrence in GBS patients. We hypothesize that EMV will reduce the incidence of pneumonia. METHODS: This was a single centre, open-label, randomized controlled trial performed on two parallel groups. 50 intensive care unit adults admitted for Guillain-Barré syndrome and at risk for acute respiratory failure. Patients were randomized to early mechanical ventilation via face-mask or endotracheal intubation owing to the presence or absence of impaired swallowing (experimental arm), or to conventional care (control arm). The primary outcome was the incidence of pneumonia up to intensive care unit discharge (or 90 days, pending of which occurred first). FINDINGS: Twenty-five patients were randomized in each group. There was no significant difference between groups for the incidence of pneumonia (10/25 (40%) vs 9/25 (36%), P = 1). There was no significant difference between groups for the time to onset of pneumonia (P = 0.50, Gray test). During follow-up, there were 16/25 (64%) mechanically ventilated patients in the control group, and 25/25 (100%) in the experimental arm (P < 000·1). The time on ventilator was non-significantly shorter in the experimental arm (14 [7; 29] versus 21.5 [17.3; 35.5], P = 0.10). There were no significant differences between groups for length of hospital stay, neurological scores, the proportion of patients who needed tracheostomy, in-hospital death, or any serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study including adults with Guillain-Barré syndrome at high risk of respiratory failure, we did not observe a prevention of pneumonia with early mechanical ventilation.

Report of 19 Cases and Review of the Literature,10.1007/s10350-004-0531-1,PMC7177015,15129312,no-cc,"PURPOSE: Acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is characterized by sudden onset, painless, and massive hemorrhage from rectal ulcer(s) in patients with serious underlying illnesses. It is a matter of controversy whether acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is a distinct clinical entity. This is the first Asian report on acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome to be made outside Japan. METHODS: From January 1989 to December 1999, 8,085 patients underwent total colonoscopy at our institution. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records and colonoscopic files. The diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome was made by means of the clinical, histologic, and colonoscopic findings. RESULTS: Among the 8,085 patients, 19 patients (11 males; mean age, 71.2 ± 10.1 years) were diagnosed with acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome, which accounted for 2.8 percent of the patients with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The duration from hospitalization to the onset of massive bleeding ranged from 3 to 14 (mean, 9 ± 3.3) days. Characteristics of colonoscopic appearance were solitary or multiple rectal ulcer(s), with round, circumferential, geographical, or Dieulafoy-like lesions located within a mean of 4.7 cm ± 1.5 cm from the dentate line. Histopathologically, the lesions appeared as necrosis with denudation of covering epithelium, hemorrhage, and multiple thrombi in the vessels of the mucosa and underlying stroma, which is considered to be similar to stress-related mucosa injury. Successful hemostasis was obtained in 74 percent (14/19) of patients with direct therapeutic maneuvers. Prognosis was largely dependent on accurate diagnosis and management of the underlying disorders. CONCLUSIONS: We assert that acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is a rare but important entity and stress that awareness of this clinical entity should lead to a high index of suspicion resulting in early detection, diagnosis, and appropriate therapy.",2004-05-04,"Tseng, Chang-An; Chen, Li-Tzong; Tsai, Kun-Bow; Su, Yu-Chung; Wu, Deng-Chyang; Jan, Chang-Ming; Wang, Wen-Ming; Pan, Yong-Sang",Dis Colon Rectum,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7ba728305beeae3e2857f7e6245184f7ea3c9498.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177015.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7177015/,

For several directly transmitted diseases, reinfection is a relevant process, which can be expressed by endogenous reactivation of the pathogen or by exogenous reinfection due to direct contact with an infected individual (with smaller reinfection rate [Formula: see text] than infection rate [Formula: see text]). In this paper, we examine the stochastic susceptible, infected, recovered, infected (SIRI) model simulating the endogenous reactivation by a spontaneous reaction, while exogenous reinfection by a catalytic reaction. Analyzing the mean-field approximations of a site and pairs of sites, and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the particular case of exogenous reinfection, we obtained continuous phase transitions involving endemic, epidemic, and no transmission phases for the simple approach; the approach of pairs is better to describe the phase transition from endemic phase (susceptible, infected, susceptible (SIS)-like model) to epidemic phase (susceptible, infected, and removed or recovered (SIR)-like model) considering the comparison with MC results; the reinfection increases the peaks of outbreaks until the system reaches endemic phase. For the particular case of endogenous reactivation, the approach of pairs leads to a continuous phase transition from endemic phase (SIS-like model) to no transmission phase. Finally, there is no phase transition when both effects are taken into account.

However, the mechanisms underlying host immune responses in intestinal mucosa against the early enterovirus infections remain elusive. Here, we showed that human enteroviruses including enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and poliovirus 1 (PV1) predominantly induce type III interferons (IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2/3), rather than type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β), in cultured human normal and cancerous intestine epithelial cells (IECs), mouse intestine tissues, and human clinical intestine specimens. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that IFN-λ production is induced upon enterovirus infection through the Toll-like receptor 3/interferon regulatory factor 1 (TLR3/IRF1) signaling pathway in IECs. In turn, the supplementation of IFN-λ subsequently induces intrinsically antiviral responses against enterovirus replication. Notably, intraperitoneal injection in neonatal C57BL/6J mice with mouse recombinant IFN-λ2 protein represses EV71 replication and protects mice from viral lethal effects. Altogether, these results revealed a distinct mechanism by which the host elicited immune responses against enterovirus infections in intestine through activating the TLR3/IRF1/type III IFN axis.

This systematic review aimed at identifying the common psychosocial factors that predict the subjective and psychological well-being in RTW processes after having a long-standing health problem or disability. Objective: To evaluate the subjective and psychological well-being at work of employees with chronic or long-standing health problems or those returning to work after any cause of disability. Data source: Systematic review of articles published in English or Spanish using PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE, Psychology, and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and Pubpsych. An additional study was identified by contacting expert academics in the field. The search equations used included terms such as Return to Work, Long-Standing Health Problems or Disability, Work Health Balance, and job satisfaction or subjective well-being. Eligibility criteria for the studies: Studies that included a measure of employees’ well-being at work following return to work were selected for the review. Evaluation of the studies and synthesis methods: The studies were selected using predefined fields which included quality criteria. Results: Of the 264 articles returned by the initial search, a total of 20 were finally selected. Results were organized around the three different theoretical approaches for understanding RTW and its antecedents and consequences: (a) RTW and autonomy at work have a positive effect on psychological well-being; (b) job demand is linked to less job satisfaction, whereas a higher level on the work–health balance is associated with job satisfaction and work engagement; (c) internal and external support is linked to job satisfaction in the case of a disease. Limitations: The evidence provided by the results is restricted by the limited availability of studies focusing on well-being at work following return to work. Moreover, the studies identified are of different kinds, thereby preventing comparisons.

METHODS: We queried the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) to identify patients undergoing urological surgery in 2015–2016. We evaluated the 30-day incidence and factors associated with postoperative CDI and 30-day hospital readmission and length of stay as secondary outcomes. Among the subset of patients undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary diversion (surgery with highest CDI incidence) we used multivariable logistic regression analysis to evaluate independent clinical and demographic factors associated with postoperative CDI. RESULTS: We identified 98,463 patients during the study period. The overall 30-day incidence of CDI was 0.31%, but varied considerably across surgery type. The risk of CDI was greatest following radical cystectomy with urinary diversion (2.72%) compared to all other urologic procedures (0.19%) and was associated with increased risk of hospital readmission (p < 0.0001), re-operation (p < 0.0001), and longer mean length of stay (p < 0.0001) in this cohort. Among patients undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary diversion, multivariable logistic regression revealed that preoperative renal failure (OR: 5.30, 95% CI 1.13–24.9, p = 0.035) and blood loss requiring transfusion (OR: 1.67, 95% CI 1.15–2.44, p = 0.0075) were independently associated with CDI. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally representative cohort, the incidence of CDI was low but varied substantially across surgery types. CDI was most common following radical cystectomy and associated with potentially modifiable factors such as blood transfusion and significantly longer length of stay.

To qualitatively evaluate participants’ experience with and perceptions of a genetic education program as an adjunct to genetic counseling, we conducted direct observations of the intervention, semi-structured in person interviews with 11 women who viewed CREdIT, and post-counseling questionnaires with the two participating genetic counselors. Five themes emerged from the analysis of interviews: (1) genetic counseling and testing for breast/ovarian cancer was a new concept; (2) CREdIT’s story format was particularly appealing; (3) changes in participants’ perceived risk for breast cancer varied; (4) some misunderstandings about individual risk and heredity persisted after CREdIT and counseling; (5) the context for viewing CREdIT shaped responses to the presentation. Observations demonstrated ways to make the information provided in CREdIT and by genetic counselors more consistent. In a post-session counselor questionnaire, counselors’ rating of the patient’s preparedness before the session was significantly higher for patients who viewed CREdIT prior to their appointments than for other patients. This novel educational tool fills a gap in HBOC education by tailoring information to women of lower literacy and diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds.

Atherosclerotic changes, the primary pathological substrate for CVD, are closely related to hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, the treatment of hypercholesterolemia is a key therapeutic strategy for CVD management. Statins, as the gold standard in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, have shown enhanced cardiac outcomes in many randomized clinical trials. However, often despite the maximum allowed and tolerated dosage of statins, we are not able to reach the target cholesterol levels, and thus patients persist at an increased cardiovascular risk. Recently, most of the large clinical studies in the field of preventive cardiology have focused on proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and its activity regulation. PCSK9 plays an essential role in the metabolism of LDL particles by inhibiting LDL receptor recirculation to the cell surface. Recent studies have shown that inhibition of PCSK9 by the administration of monoclonal antibodies is capable of significantly reducing LDL levels (up to an additional 60%) as well as reducing the incidence of CVD. However, this treatment procedure of administering the anti-PCSK9 antibodies, most frequently two times a month, has its limitations in terms of time, patient adherence, and nevertheless cost. Administration of active vaccination instead of passive immunization with anti-PCSK9 antibodies may be an effective way of controlling blood cholesterol levels. However, clinical data, as well as human testing, are still inadequate.

Highly accurate diagnostics are important in low Schistosoma transmission areas. Pregnant women and young children could particularly benefit from antigen testing as praziquantel (PZQ) can be given to only confirmed Schistosoma cases. This prevents the unborn baby from unnecessary exposure to PZQ. We present here the protocol of a diagnostic study that forms part of the freeBILy project. The aim is to evaluate the accuracy of circulating anodic antigen (CAA) detection for diagnosis of Schistosoma haematobium infections in pregnant women and to validate CAA as an endpoint measure for anti-Schistosoma drug efficacy. The study will also investigate Schistosoma infections in infants. METHODS: A set of three interlinked prospective, observational studies is conducted in Gabon. The upconverting phosphor lateral flow (UCP-LF) CAA test is the index diagnostic test that will be evaluated. The core trial, sub-study A, comprehensively evaluates the accuracy of the UCP-LF CAA urine test against a set of other Schistosoma diagnostics in a cross-sectional trial design. Women positive for S. haematobium will proceed with sub-study B and will be randomised to receive PZQ treatment immediately or after delivery followed by weekly sample collection. This approach includes comparative monitoring of CAA levels following PZQ intake and will also contribute further data for safety of PZQ administration during pregnancy. Sub-study C is a longitudinal study to determine the incidence of S. haematobium infection as well as the age for first infection in life-time. DISCUSSION: The freeBILy trial in Gabon will generate a comprehensive set of data on the accuracy of the UCP-LF CAA test for the detection of S. haematobium infection in pregnant women and newborn babies and for the use of CAA as a marker to determine PZQ efficacy. Furthermore, incidence of Schistosoma infection in infants will be reported. Using the ultrasensitive diagnostics, this information will be highly relevant for Schistosoma prevalence monitoring by national control programs as well as for the development of medicaments and vaccines.

From the AHc protein, a small peptide NL13 was identified using bioinformatics tools and was predicted to have antioxidant property. Further, the peptide was synthesised and its antioxidant mechanism was addressed at molecular level. NL13 was subjected to various antioxidant assays including DPPH assay, HARS assay, SARS Assay, NO assay and ABTS assay, where NL13 exhibited significant (P < 0.05) potential antioxidant activity compared to its antioxidant control, Trolox. Cytotoxicity was performed on Human whole blood and the cell viability was performed on VERO fibroblast cells. In both assays, it was found that NL13 did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect towards the cells. Further, the intracellular ROS was performed on Multimode reader followed by imaging on fluorescence microscope which showed scavenging activity even at lower concentration of NL13 (31.2 µM). An effective wound healing property of NL13 on VERO cells was confirmed by analysing the cell migration rate at two different time intervals (24 and 48 h). Overall, the study shows that NL13 peptide scavenges the intracellular oxidative stress.

Identification of readiness for weaning from CPAP can balance benefits with risks of CPAP exposure. We tested the hypothesis that preterm infants that successfully transition off CPAP have higher oxygen saturations prior to weaning compared with infants who fail weaning from CPAP. METHODS: This was a single-center-matched case–control study in infants ≤30 weeks’ gestation receiving ≤30% FiO(2) weaned off CPAP during the first postnatal week. Cases were infants placed back on CPAP within 7 days of being taken off CPAP, whereas control infants remained off CPAP for 7 consecutive days following CPAP discontinuation. Infants were matched on gestational age at birth (±10 days). Prospectively collected histograms detailing the distribution of oxygen saturations prior to CPAP discontinuation were compared between cases and controls. RESULTS: Over a 12-month monitoring period, 36 infants met inclusion criteria. Baseline characteristics, morbidities, and clinical variables did not differ between cases and controls. Controls achieved oxygen saturations of 95–97 and 97–100% for longer duration compared to cases (p < 0.05).

Material and locations The extant fern taxa occupying Africa south of the Sahara, Madagascar and some islands of the South Atlantic. Methods The number of taxa in each area or operational geographical unit (OGU) was scored, and the correlation between this number and physical and climatic variables analysed by standard pairwise and stepwise multiple regression analysis (SPR and SMR). The effects of biological factors such as dispersal capacity, reproductive biology, genetic features and certain physiological adaptations were evaluated by comparing the number of species in each OGU. Floral affinities among OGUs were analysed using non‐metric multi‐dimensional scaling (NMS) and parsimonic analysis of dispersion (PAD), and compared with β‐turnover and inter‐OGU distances. Results OGU area, elevation and the distance between refuges determined the composition of local floras, but only greater OGU area and the existence of higher maximum elevations increased species richness. The distance between refuges also affected the number of endemic species, especially on islands. The biological features studied only slightly influenced fern distribution. The main climatic predictor of species number was humidity. SPR and SMR revealed three main groups of ferns with different ecological trends. NMS and PAD analyses separated the four areas of highest diversity in Africa, three of which are inhabited by ferns with distinct ecological requirements. The fourth area was Madagascar, which shows an accumulation of endemic and relict diversity that is not easy to explain. Main conclusions The distribution of ferns in Africa has been influenced by refuges. These probably allowed many species to recolonize the neighbouring areas after the extinctions of the Pleistocene. Three major components were detected in the African flora: Guinea‐Congolian thermophilous, cold‐tolerant Afro‐montane, and Southern drought‐tolerant elements. These are related to the three main refuge areas, i.e. the Gulf of Guinea area, the eastern tropical region, and the Cape region. Endemicity in ferns was found to be lower than that of seed plants due to the higher dispersability of fern spores. The distance between OGUs seems to be the main predictor of the number of endemic fern species these areas contain.",2004-09-13,"Aldasoro, J.

In the Cyclades plateau (Aegean Sea), a qualitative and quantitative analysis of macro‐benthic fauna was carried out in 1986. Standard multivariate analysis techniques were applied to both ecological (living benthic fauna) and paleoecological data sets in order to distinguish distribution patterns. Results showed that caution must prevail in drawing conclusions from a limited data set. The clearest classification was obtained using total living fauna, while the dead molluscan fauna gave a similar pattern; this indicates similar response to the environmental conditions of the area. In the analysis of the living molluscan fauna, the groups failed to show any clusters, probably as an effect of some impoverished sites. In the two groups delineated, depth seems to be the major factor in the distribution of species. The fact that two distinct data sets (subfossil assemblages and living communities), when treated separately, produce similar grouping indicates that the subfossil assemblages could be reliably used as a first approach for determination of the living communities' distribution patterns.",2008-06-28,"Zenetos, Argyro; Papathanassiou, Evangelos; Aartsen, Jacobus J.

No vaccine or cure exists, although symptomatic onset may be delayed with some chemoprophylactics. Other response and management strategies have focused on nutritional status, cleanliness and biosecurity. We undertook a systematic review of observational studies to identify risk or protective factors that could prevent Cryptosporidium parvum infection in calves. Included studies used multivariate analysis within cohort, cross-sectional or case-control designs, of risk factors among young calves, assessing C. parvum specifically. We tabulated data on characteristics and study quality and present narrative synthesis. Fourteen eligible studies were found; three of which were higher quality. The most consistent evidence suggested that risk of C. parvum infection increased when calves had more contact with other calves, were in larger herds or in organic production. Hard flooring reduced risk of infection and calves tended to have more cryptosporidiosis during warm and wet weather. While many other factors were not found to be associated with C. parvum infection, analyses were usually badly underpowered, due to clustering of management factors. Trials are needed to assess effects of manipulating calf contact, herd size, organic methods, hard flooring and temperature. Other factors need to be assessed in larger observational studies with improved disaggregation of potential risk factors.

This energy is used to support photosynthesis, a process in which carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is incorporated into organic compounds in the plant to allow the plant to grow. Other parts of the plant, such as the stem, flowers, or seeds are also able to conduct photosynthesis to contribute to growth in many plant species. The main contribution of photosynthesis in these parts of the plant may be to use carbon dioxide produced by the plant in respiration rather than from the surrounding atmosphere. The biochemical processes used by the plant in these organs may be different from those used in the leaves of the same plant. This process is enhanced in plants under stress and may be important for plant survival in some situations. Increased knowledge of these processes may be used to develop plant varieties that are more tolerant of environmental extremes and could help adapt agriculture to climate change. ABSTRACT: Plants have leaves as specialised organs that capture light energy by photosynthesis. However, photosynthesis is also found in other plant organs. Photosynthesis may be found in the petiole, stems, flowers, fruits, and seeds. All photosynthesis can contribute to the capture of carbon and growth of the plant. The benefit to the plant of photosynthesis in these other tissues or organs may often be associated with the need to re-capture carbon especially in storage organs that have high respiration rates. Some plants that conduct C(3) photosynthesis in the leaves have been reported to use C(4) photosynthesis in petioles, stems, flowers, fruits, or seeds. These pathways of non-leaf photosynthesis may be especially important in supporting plant growth under stress and may be a key contributor to plant growth and survival. Pathways of photosynthesis have directionally evolved many times in different plant lineages in response to environmental selection and may also have differentiated in specific parts of the plant. This consideration may be useful in the breeding of crop plants with enhanced performance in response to climate change.",2020-12-02,"Henry, Robert J.; Furtado, Agnelo; Rangan, Parimalan",Biology (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d8dd256c40bac9337e57335acbe28809a5ea7fd0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7760132.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7760132/,

METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in three databases up until March 2020 (PROSPERO registration nr CRD42019126764). RESULTS: N = 5 studies including 438 participants (age 48–80) with body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m(2) met the eligibility criteria and were included. The duration of the interventions ranged from 8 to 24 weeks. No study measured the primary outcome VAT, although in N = 4 studies, waist circumference (WC) decreased by between 1.3 and 5.6 cm in the intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows that there is no evidence for the effects of digital exercise on VAT, although digital exercise may decrease WC. These findings highlight the need for additional randomized controlled trials to confirm the findings with respect to WC, and to further investigate the effects of digital exercise on VAT. Together, this may have important implications for reducing the burden of physical inactivity and obesity.",2020-05-14,"Ballin, Marcel; Hult, Andreas; Björk, Sabine; Dinsmore, John; Nordström, Peter; Nordström, Anna",Int J Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6bc85b49fded6e1c65279bad1218477f070b438c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c4c08f33da5f7c6a861641862ef22f6f38f3ce51.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7224590.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224590/,

A ten-day online randomized controlled trial with the use of smartphone apps, engaging participants in mindfulness exercises, self-monitoring and mood tracking, was implemented amongst UK university students (n = 143). Participants were asked to complete online pre- and post-intervention assessments. Results indicated high effect sizes in reduction of smartphone distraction and improvement scores on a number of self-reported secondary psychological outcomes. The intervention was not effective in reducing habitual behaviours, nomophobia, or time spent on social media. Mediation analyses demonstrated that: (i) emotional self-awareness but not mindful attention mediated the relationship between intervention effects and smartphone distraction, and (ii) online vigilance mediated the relationship between smartphone distraction and problematic social media use. The present study provides preliminary evidence of the efficacy of an intervention for decreased smartphone distraction and highlights psychological processes involved in this emergent phenomenon in the smartphone literature. Online interventions may serve as complementary strategies to reduce distraction levels and promote insight into online engagement. More research is required to elucidate the mechanisms of digital distraction and assess its implications in problematic use.",2020-07-05,"Throuvala, Melina A.; Griffiths, Mark D.; Rennoldson, Mike; Kuss, Daria J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0bf678f28841b3a0691c0562ab19744f36fd094a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7369880.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7369880/,

Any disruption of iron homeostasis leads to either iron deficiency or iron overload, which can be detrimental for humans’ health, especially in elderly. Each of these changes contributes to the faster development of many neurological disorders or stimulates progression of already present diseases. Age-related cellular and molecular alterations in iron metabolism can also lead to iron dyshomeostasis and deposition. Iron deposits can contribute to the development of inflammation, abnormal protein aggregation, and degeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to the progressive decline in cognitive processes, contributing to pathophysiology of stroke and dysfunctions of body metabolism. Besides, since iron plays an important role in both neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, dietary iron homeostasis should be considered with caution. Recently, there has been increased interest in sex-related differences in iron metabolism and iron homeostasis. These differences have not yet been fully elucidated.

We find that low oxygen level diminishes CD8(+) T cell anti-viral response in vivo. We reveal that respiratory restriction inhibits ATP-dependent matrix processes that are critical for mitochondrial-biogenesis. This respiratory restriction-mediated effect could be rescued by TCA cycle re-stimulation, which yielded increased mitochondrial matrix-localized ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation.

An outbreak of dengue-like illness (DLI) that occurred in April 2016 prompted this study, which aimed to determine the population’s immunity status and identify the arboviruses circulating in the country. METHODS: A household survey, involving 188 participants in two urban areas (Honiara and Gizo), and a parallel hospital-based clinical survey were conducted in April 2016. The latter was repeated in December after a surge in DLI cases. Arbovirus IgG ELISA were performed on the household blood samples to determine the prevalence of arboviruses in the community, while qPCR testing of the clinical samples was used to identify the circulating arboviruses. Dengue virus (DENV)-positive samples were further characterized by amplifying and sequencing the envelope gene. RESULTS: The overall prevalence rates of DENV, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus were 83.4%, 7.6%, and 0.9%, respectively. The qPCR positivity rates of the clinical samples collected in April 2016 were as follows: DENV 39.6%, Zika virus 16.7%, and chikungunya virus 6.3%, which increased to 74%, 48%, and 20% respectively in December 2016. The displacement of the circulating serotype-3, genotype-1, with DENV serotype 2, genotype cosmopolitan was responsible for the outbreak in 2016. CONCLUSIONS: A DENV outbreak in Solomon Islands was caused by the introduction of a single serotype. The high prevalence of DENV provided transient cross-protection, which prevented the introduction of a new serotype from the hyperendemic region for at least 3 years. The severe outcomes seen in the recent outbreak probably resulted from changes in the causative viruses and the effects of population immunity and changes in the outbreak pattern.

Patients eligible for surgery, increasingly receive neo-adjuvant therapy before surgery or adjuvant therapy afterward, inherently exposing them to toxicity. As such, optimizing physical function through exercise during treatment remains imperative to optimize quality of life either before surgery or during rehabilitation. However, current exercise efficacy and prescription in pancreatic cancer is unknown. Therefore, this study aims to summarise the published literature on exercise studies conducted in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing treatment with a focus on determining the current prescription and progression patterns being used in this population. METHODS: A systematic review of four databases identified studies evaluating the effects of exercise on aerobic fitness, muscle strength, physical function, body composition, fatigue and quality of life in participants with pancreatic cancer undergoing treatment, published up to 24 July 2020. Two reviewers independently reviewed and appraised the methodological quality of each study. RESULTS: Twelve studies with a total of 300 participants were included. Heterogeneity of the literature prevented meta-analysis. Exercise was associated with improvements in outcomes; however, study quality was variable with the majority of studies receiving a weak rating. CONCLUSIONS: High quality evidence regarding the efficacy and prescription of exercise in pancreatic cancer is lacking. Well-designed trials, which have received feedback and input from key stakeholders prior to implementation, are required to examine the impact of exercise in pancreatic cancer on key cancer related health outcomes.

Upon recognition of protein fragments (peptides), activated T cells will contribute to the immune response and help clear infection.

This recognition event is the first step that leads to T cell activation, and in turn can dictate disease outcomes. The visualisation of TCR interaction with pMHC using structural biology has been crucial in understanding this key event, unravelling the parameters that drive this interaction and their impact on the immune response.

In heart failure patients, elevated plasma ACE2 activity predicted adverse events and greater myocardial dysfunction. We aimed to describe plasma ACE2 activity and its clinical associations in patients with kidney disease. METHODS: Patients recruited from a single centre comprised of chronic kidney disease Stage III/IV (CKD), haemodialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Plasma ACE2 enzyme activity was measured using a fluorescent substrate assay in plasma, collected at baseline and stored at −80°C. Linear regression was performed in both males and females separately to determine the covariates associated with log-transformed ACE2. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) plasma ACE2 activity in pmol/mL/min was 15.9 (8.4–26.1) in CKD (n = 59), 9.2 (3.9–18.2) in haemodialysis (n = 100) and 13.1 (5.7–21.9) in KTR (n = 80; P < 0.01). In male haemodialysis patients, ACE2 activity was 12.1 (6.8–19.6) compared with 4.4 (2.5–10.3) in females (P < 0.01). Log-transformed ACE2 plasma activity was associated with post-haemodialysis systolic blood pressure in females [β-coefficient 0.04, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.01–0.06, P = 0.006]. In males, log-transformed ACE2 plasma activity was associated with B-type natriuretic peptide (β-coefficient 0.39, 95% CI 0.19–0.60, P < 0.001). Plasma ACE2 activity was not associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma ACE2 activity is reduced in haemodialysis patients compared with CKD patients, and in female haemodialysis patients compared with male.

Antigenic property of influenza viruses are determined by both protein sequence and N-linked glycosylation of influenza glycoproteins, especially hemagglutinin (HA). The currently available computational methods are only considered features in protein sequence but not N-linked glycosylation. RESULTS: A multi-task learning sparse group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (MTL-SGL) regression method was developed and applied to derive two types of predominant features including protein sequence and N-linked glycosylation in hemagglutinin (HA) affecting variations in serologic data for human and swine H1N1 IAVs. Results suggested that mutations and changes in N-linked glycosylation sites are associated with the rise of antigenic variants of H1N1 IAVs. Furthermore, the implicated mutations are predominantly located at five reported antibody-binding sites, and within or close to the HA receptor binding site. All of the three N-linked glycosylation sites (i.e. sequons NCSV at HA 54, NHTV at HA 125, and NLSK at HA 160) identified by MTL-SGL to determine antigenic changes were experimentally validated in the H1N1 antigenic variants using mass spectrometry analyses. Compared with conventional sparse learning methods, MTL-SGL achieved a lower prediction error and higher accuracy, indicating that grouped features and MTL in the MTL-SGL method are not only able to handle serologic data generated from multiple reagents, supplies, and protocols, but also perform better in genetic sequence-based antigenic quantification. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the results of this study suggest that mutations and variations in N-glycosylation in HA caused antigenic variations in H1N1 IAVs and that the sequence-based antigenicity predictive model will be useful in understanding antigenic evolution of IAVs.",2020-05-11,"Li, Lei; Chang, Deborah; Han, Lei; Zhang, Xiaojian; Zaia, Joseph; Wan, Xiu-Feng",BMC Bioinformatics,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c3adcfa1d0b009368d01f9d47534bd368fd6e215.json; document_parses/pdf_json/45b7a7ee38dd141968ea600d4ca0799f7b3b34ae.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7216668.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7216668/,

Loss of harmony due to dopamine deficiency is considered the primary pathological cause of the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recent progress in experimental approaches has enabled us to examine the striatal circuitry in a much more comprehensive manner, not only reshaping our understanding of striatal functions in movement regulation but also leading to new opportunities for the development of therapeutic strategies for treating PD. In addition to dopaminergic innervation, giant aspiny cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) within the striatum have long been recognized as a critical node for balancing dopamine signaling and regulating movement. With the roles of ChIs in motor control further uncovered and more specific manipulations available, striatal ChIs and their corresponding receptors are emerging as new promising therapeutic targets for PD.

Despite its wide presence in mammals, to date, dental calculus has primarily been used to study primate microbiome evolution. We establish dental calculus as a valuable tool for the study of nonhuman host microbiome evolution, by using shotgun metagenomics to characterize the taxonomic and functional composition of the oral microbiome in species as diverse as gorillas, bears, and reindeer. We detect oral pathogens in individuals with evidence of oral disease, assemble near-complete bacterial genomes from historical specimens, characterize antibiotic resistance genes, reconstruct components of the host diet, and recover host genetic profiles. Our work demonstrates that metagenomic analyses of dental calculus can be performed on a diverse range of mammalian species, which will allow the study of oral microbiome and pathogen evolution from a comparative perspective. As dental calculus is readily preserved through time, it can also facilitate the quantification of the impact of anthropogenic changes on wildlife and the environment.",2020-05-28,"Brealey, Jaelle C; Leitão, Henrique G; van der Valk, Tom; Xu, Wenbo; Bougiouri, Katia; Dalén, Love; Guschanski, Katerina",Mol Biol Evol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7a48d6b896a6a20f1e0a2daaf94400d67f178ee3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7530607.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7530607/,

Biofilms can become thick enough to be even observed by the naked eye, and biofilm formation is a tightly regulated process. Paracoccus denitrificans is a non-motile, Gram-negative bacterium that forms a very thin, unique biofilm. A key factor in the biofilm formed by this bacterium is a large surface protein named biofilm-associated protein A (BapA), which was recently reported to be regulated by cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (cyclic-di-GMP or c-di-GMP). Cyclic-di-GMP is a major second messenger involved in biofilm formation in many bacteria. Though cyclic-di-GMP is generally reported as a positive regulatory factor in biofilm formation, it represses biofilm formation in P. denitrificans. Furthermore, quorum sensing (QS) represses biofilm formation in this bacterium, which is also reported as a positive regulator of biofilm formation in most bacteria. The QS signal used in P. denitrificans is hydrophobic and is delivered through membrane vesicles. Studies on QS show that P. denitrificans can potentially form a thick biofilm but maintains a thin biofilm under normal growth conditions. In this review, we discuss the peculiarities of biofilm formation by P. denitrificans with the aim of deepening the overall understanding of bacterial biofilm formation and functions.",2020-01-30,"Morinaga, Kana; Yoshida, Keitaro; Takahashi, Kohei; Nomura, Nobuhiko; Toyofuku, Masanori",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8c5d2b18545733ac55ebb0d1fb11fc94c28f4f48.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7223048.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223048/,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes of RAMIE using the microanatomy-based concept in the initial introduction phase. METHODS: We have performed more than 500 TEPP procedures as minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). After performing about 400 cases of MIE, we established a microanatomy-based standardization of UMLND. In October 2018, we introduced RAMIE, and have performed 75 procedures in 20 months. Two groups were analyzed: a group after microanatomy-based standardization in TEPP (100 cases after completing 400 cases of TEPP) and a RAMIE group (75 cases). Finally, 51 paired cases were matched using a propensity score. Furthermore, the change in postoperative short-term outcome for RAMIE in the initial introduction phase was analyzed. RESULTS: Although there were no significant differences between the two groups in the number of upper mediastinal lymph nodes dissected, there was a significant decrease (P = 0.036) in intraoperative blood loss volume with RAMIE, representing a definite benefit for patients. The thoracoscopic operative time for RAMIE decreased by almost 100 min following less than 50 cases of experience, reaching the same level as that for recent TEPP, but with only one-tenth the operator experience. There were no significant differences in the total postoperative morbidity rate including the recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy rate.

However, uncertainty remained regarding the effect of AD itself and comorbidities (e.g., allergic diseases, cataract surgery) on RRD occurrence in a large, population-based paediatric population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed the 12-year National Health Insurance Service database (2002–2013) covering the entire Korean population to estimate the association between AD and RRD in people aged under 20 years. RESULTS: We identified 3142 RRD patients, and matched 18,852 controls (six controls to each RRD patient); therefore, we included 21,994 peoples under aged 20 years in the analyses. AD was more prevalent in the RRD group (329 patients, 10.47%) than the control group (1043 patients, 5.53%; P < 0.001), and so were severe AD (153 patients [4.87%] and 223 patients [1.18%], respectively; P < 0.001). In conditional logistic regression analysis, AD was associated with RRD (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.93–1.87) even after adjusting for allergic conditions, connective tissue disease, uveitis, and cataract surgery. In addition, severity of AD was associated with an increased risk of RRD (OR for non-severe AD and severe AD, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.05–1.51] and 2.88 [95% CI, 2.25–3.68]).

Here, we show that two distinct H1N2 swine influenza viruses contain avian-like or classical swine-like hemagglutinins with polymerase acidic (PA) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes from 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses that were found to be circulating in Korean pigs in 2018. Swine H1N2 influenza virus containing an avian-like hemagglutinin gene had enhanced pathogenicity, causing severe interstitial pneumonia in infected pigs and mice. The mortality rate of mice infected with swine H1N2 influenza virus containing an avian-like hemagglutinin gene was higher by 100% when compared to that of mice infected with swine H1N2 influenza virus harbouring classical swine-like hemagglutinin. Further, chemokines attracting inflammatory cells were strongly induced in lung tissues of pigs and mice infected by swine H1N2 influenza virus containing an avian-like hemagglutinin gene.

Thus, to identify key prospective malaria antigens for vaccine development, there is the need to evaluate the associations between malaria antibodies and antibody dependent host factors with more rigorous statistical methods. In this study, different statistical models were used to evaluate the predictive performance of malaria-specific antibodies and host gene polymorphisms on P. falciparum infection in a longitudinal cohort study involving Ghanaian children. METHODS: Models with different functional forms were built using known predictors (age, sickle cell status, blood group status, parasite density, and mosquito bed net use) and malaria antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgG subclasses and FCGR3B polymorphisms shown to mediate antibody-dependent cellular functions. Malaria antigens studied were Merozoite surface proteins (MSP-1 and MSP-3), Glutamate Rich Protein (GLURP)-R0, R2, and the Apical Membrane Antigen (AMA-1). The models were evaluated through visualization and assessment of differences between the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Brier Score estimated by suitable internal cross-validation designs.

During peak season, picornaviruses cause 82% of all episodes of acute nasopharyngitis (the common cold), the most frequent manifestation of acute respiratory infection, and produce more restriction of activity and physician consultations annually than any other viral or bacterial source of respiratory illness. Objective: This article reviews the clinical impact and outcomes of picornavirus-induced respiratory infections in specific populations at risk for complications. It also discusses the potential economic impact of the morbidity associated with picornavirus-induced respiratory infection. Methods: Relevant literature was identified through searches of MEDLINE, OVID, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Lexis-Nexis. The search terms used were picornavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, viral respiratory infection, upper respiratory infection, disease burden, economic, cost, complications, asthma, COPD, immunocompromised, elderly, otitis media, and sinusitis. Additional publications were identified from the reference lists of the retrieved articles. Conclusions: Based on the clinical literature, picornavirus infections are associated with severe morbidity as well as considerable economic and societal costs. Future research should focus on identifying patterns of illness and the costs associated with management of these infections. New treatments should be assessed not only in terms of their ability to produce the desired clinical outcome, but also in terms of their ability to reduce the burden of disease, decrease health care costs, and improve productivity.",2002-01-03,"Monto, Arnold S.; Fendrick, A.Mark; Sarnes, Matthew W.",Clin Ther,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172950/,

Although most parts of moringa tree have been widely studied, seeds remained scarcely explored. The first goal of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of germination to improve the nutritional composition (proximate composition and levels of vitamins B1 and B2), content of bioactive compounds (glucosinolates, phenolics and γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA) and antioxidant activity of moringa seed. Germination improved protein, fat, fiber, riboflavin, phenolics, some individual glucosinolates (GLS) and GABA contents, as well as the antioxidant potential in moringa sprouts, but the extent of the improvement depended on germination conditions. The second objective of this work was to identify the optimal germination conditions to maximize nutritional and bioactive quality of moringa by applying multi-response optimization (response surface methodology, RSM). RSM models indicated that 28 °C and 24 h were the optimal conditions to enhance the accumulation of riboflavin, phenolics and antioxidant activity of sprouts, while the highest GABA and total GLS contents were observed at 36 °C for 96 h and thiamine achieved the maximum content at 36 °C for 24 h.

Clinically, ribavirin has been used effectively in persons primarily to treat life‐threatening viral diseases such as acute haemorrhagic fever or viral pneumonia of infants. In order to evaluate the feasibility of using this antiviral agent in cats, the effects of oral (p.o.), intramuscular (i.m.) and intravenous (i.v.) doses of ribavirin in 27 9‐month‐old specific‐pathogen‐free cats were evaluated by haematology, clinical chemistries, bone marrow biopsies and histopathology. Ribavirin was administered once daily for 10 consecutive days at a dose of either 11, 22, or 44 mg/kg after which all cats were euthanatized and necropsied. Most cats receiving 22 or 44 mg of ribavirin/kg became anorectic and suffered some degree of weight loss (0.2 to 0.6 kg), and about one‐third of the cats developed diarrhoea and/or mucous membrane pallor. Icterus or haemorrhage was not observed. The most profound and consistent haemato‐logic change, particularly among the moderate and high dosage groups regardless of route of administration, was a significant and severe thrombocytopenia (range, 33–78% reduction in mean platelet counts vs. baseline). Other changes, particularly reductions in total WBC and neutrophils and reductions in RBC and PCV, tended to occur at lower ribavirin dosages, but generally they were not statistically significant. Cats given 44 mg of ribavirin/kg i.v. showed significant decreases in leukocyte variables, including total WBC (P = 0.016), neutrophils (P= 0.026) and lymphocytes (P= 0.047). Mild‐to‐moderate increases in serum alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities occurred at doses of 22 and 44 mg/kg. Evaluation of bone marrow biopsies before and after treatment revealed that cats given 11 mg of ribavirin/kg had mild megakaryocytic (MK) hypoplasia, whereas cats receiving 22 or 44 mg/kg had progressively severe degrees of MK hypoplasia and dysplasia, asynchronous MK maturation, and increased myeloidrerythroid ratio. Pathologic changes in ribavirin‐treated cats generally were mild and included primarily enteritis (seven cats) and hepatocellular vacuolation and/or centrilobular necrosis (seven cats). Results of this study in cats indicated that daily administration of ribavirin at a dose range of 11 to 44 mg/kg induced a dose‐related toxic effect on bone marrow, primarily on megakaryocytes and erythroid precursors, and at the higher dosages it suppressed numbers of circulating leukocytes.",2008-04-17,"WEISS, R.

The underlying mechanism of anti-obesity effect of A. muricata was investigated. The fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) is a validated potential target for anti-obesity drugs. METHODS: The interaction of compounds previously characterized from A. muricata was investigated against FTO using Autodock Vina. Also, modulation of FTO and STAT-3 mRNA expression by A. muricata was investigated in high fat diet induced obese rats (HFDR) using RT-PCR. RESULTS: A significant up-regulation of FTO gene was observed in HFDR when compared to control rats, while administration of A. muricata (200 mg/kg) significantly (p < 0.05) down-regulated FTO gene expression when compared to HFDR group. The effect of obesity on STAT-3 gene expression was also reversed by A. muricata (200 mg/kg). In silico study revealed annonaine and annonioside (−9.2 kcal/mol) exhibited the highest binding affinity with FTO, followed by anonaine and isolaureline (−8.6 kcal/mol). Arg-96 is a critical amino acid enhancing anonaine, isolaureline-FTO binding. CONCLUSION: This study suggests the possible anti-obesity mechanism of A. muricata is via down-regulation of FTO with concomitant up-regulation of STAT-3 genes.

Although a few studies have assessed these topics in a laboratory setting, little is known about the magnitude of discomfort and the level of exertion experienced by workers while they deliver health care to patients for prolonged periods. The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of discomfort and level of exertion experienced by health care workers while wearing respiratory protection for periods up to 8 hr when performing their typical occupational duties. This project was a multiple cross-over field trial of 27 health care workers, aged 24–65, performing their typical, hospital-based occupational duties. Each participant served as his/her own control and wore one of seven respirators or a medical mask for 8 hr (or as long as tolerable) with interposed doffing periods every 2 hr. Self-perceived discomfort and exertion were quantified before each doffing: self-perceived level of discomfort using a visual analog scale, and self-perceived level of exertion using a Borg scale. Overall, and as would be expected, discomfort increased over time with continual respirator use over an 8-hr period. Interestingly, exertion increased only marginally over the same time period. The relatively low level of exertion associated with eight respiratory protective devices, including models commonly used in the U.S. health care workplace, is not likely to substantially influence workers’ tolerability or occupational productivity. However, the magnitude of discomfort does appear to increase significantly over time with prolonged wear. These results suggest that respirator-related discomfort, but not exertion, negatively influences respirator tolerance over prolonged periods. Discomfort may also interfere with the occupational duties of workers.",2011-12-14,"Shenal, Brian V.; Radonovich, Lewis J.; Cheng, Jing; Hodgson, Michael; Bender, Bradley S.",J Occup Environ Hyg,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/dec004e1d86c83df7737395a72b77a7551042782.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196691.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196691/,

ManN inhibits glycosylation in ECs and induces significant changes in N-glycan and O-glycan profiles. We further demonstrate that ManN and two N-glycosylation inhibitors stimulate EC proliferation via both JNK activation and the unfolded protein response caused by ER stress. ManN results in enhanced angiogenesis in a mouse skin injury model. ManN also promotes angiogenesis in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model, with accelerated limb blood flow recovery compared to controls.

While the vaccine is now available, social acceptance remains relatively uncertain in many societies. The purpose of this study was to examine the beliefs, attitudes and practices associated with the intention to get vaccinated against the A/H1N1 virus among the general population in France. Methods: A representative sample of 1001 individuals (stratified random recruitment procedure, ages 16–90 years) was interviewed by telephone. The questionnaire included a variety of items associated with socio-demographic characteristics, risk perceptions, illness perceptions, political attitudes and worldviews as well as intention to get vaccinated. Results: More than 6 out of 10 of the respondents indicated that they planned to get vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available. The same proportion of parents also reported the intention to vaccinate their children against the disease. In multiple regression analyses, socio-cognitive factors consistently predicting influenza A/H1N1 vaccination were: level of worry, risk perception and previous experience of vaccine against seasonal flu. Conclusions: The factors found to predict vaccination intention and their distribution are assumed to be a consequence of the fact that people perceive the risk of swine flu to be similar to that of seasonal flu. As a result, in the absence of an increase of the risk perception of pandemic influenza A/H1N1, a very low level of actual vaccination is forecasted. Behavioural change would require that the risks and consequences of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 be perceived as highly different from seasonal flu.",2010-05-05,"Setbon, Michel; Raude, Jocelyn",Eur J Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2711ca466a002c42da44e55f38a7a6061eef2bff.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7314046.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314046/,

Previous studies show a pivotal role of oxidative stress in PINP. Because the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been considered as the critical regulator of endogenous antioxidant defense, we here explored whether activation of Nrf2 could attenuate PINP. A rat model of PINP was established by intraperitoneal injection of paclitaxel (2 mg/kg) every other day with a final cumulative dose of 8 mg/kg. Hind paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) in response to von Frey filament stimuli were used to assess mechanical allodynia. We showed that a single dose of Nrf2 activator, oltipraz (10, 50, and 100 mg/kg), dose-dependently attenuated established mechanical allodynia, whereas repeated injection of oltipraz (100 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), i.p. from d 14 to d 18) almost abolished the mechanical allodynia in PINP rats. The antinociceptive effect of oltipraz was blocked by pre-injection of Nrf2 inhibitor trigonelline (20 mg/kg, i.p.). Early treatment with oltipraz (100 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), i.p. from d 0 to d 6) failed to prevent the development of the PINP, but delayed its onset. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 were significantly upregulated in the spinal cord of PINP rats. Repeated injection of oltipraz caused further elevation of the expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 in the spinal cord of PINP rats, which was reversed by pre-injection of trigonelline. These results demonstrate that oltipraz ameliorates PINP via activating Nrf2/HO-1-signaling pathway in the spinal cord.",2020-03-19,"Zhou, Ya-qun; Liu, Dai-qiang; Chen, Shu-ping; Chen, Nan; Sun, Jia; Wang, Xiao-mei; Cao, Fei; Tian, Yu-ke; Ye, Da-wei",Acta Pharmacol Sin,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/686ecf0f00133c3e3bbc80e17523432ccb2bf729.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7470811.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470811/,

However, the mechanism of leptin resistance remains obscure. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to produce ceramide, which plays an important role in the progression of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we investigated whether ASM could regulate leptin resistance in vascular endothelial cells. We induced endothelial leptin resistance in rat aortic endothelial cells through treatment with palmitic acid (0.3 mM) or knockdown of leptin receptor (Ob-Rb), which resulted in the increase of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 expression, the decrease of Ob-Rb expression, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation at Tyr705. We found that these indicators of leptin resistance were reversed by knockdown of ASM or by the selective ASM inhibitors amitriptyline (AMI) and imipramine (IMI). Supplementation of ceramide inhibited Ob-Rb expression and STAT3 phosphorylation by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of ASM enhanced endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity and NO production, as well as the Akt phosphorylation at ser473, which was regulated by STAT3. High-fat diet (HFD) feeding-induced leptin resistance in rats in vivo; administration of AMI and IMI (10 mg· kg(−1) per day, intraperitoneally, for 2 weeks) increased the release of endothelial NO to relieve the vasodilatory response and improved the endothelial leptin resistance in the aorta of HFD-fed rats. These results suggest that ASM downregulation reverses endothelial leptin resistance, and consequently improves vascular endothelial dysfunction. This study highlighted ASM as a potential therapeutic target for endothelial leptin resistance.",2019-12-17,"Cai, Bei-bo; Lu, Yi-ni; Xu, Ming",Acta Pharmacol Sin,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/371f94d749604dd3d2f4fbd894c7130bd9b110dc.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7471453.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471453/,

This justifies the expansion of the LFS concept to a wider cancer predisposition syndrome designated heritable TP53-related cancer (hTP53rc) syndrome; (ii) the interpretation of germline TP53 variants remains challenging and should integrate epidemiological, phenotypical, bioinformatics prediction, and functional data; (iii) the penetrance of germline disease-causing TP53 variants is variable, depending both on the type of variant (dominant-negative variants being associated with a higher cancer risk) and on modifying factors; (iv) whole-body MRI (WBMRI) allows early detection of tumours in variant carriers and (v) in cancer patients with germline disease-causing TP53 variants, radiotherapy, and conventional genotoxic chemotherapy contribute to the development of subsequent primary tumours. It is critical to perform TP53 testing before the initiation of treatment in order to avoid in carriers, if possible, radiotherapy and genotoxic chemotherapies. In children, the recommendations are to perform clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound every 6 months, annual WBMRI and brain MRI from the first year of life, if the TP53 variant is known to be associated with childhood cancers.

The purified peptides exerted an inhibitory action on mycelial growth in various fungal species. The antifungal activity of Brassica and mung bean nsLTPs were thermostable, pH‐stable, and stable after treatment with pepsin and trypsin. In contrast, the antifungal activity of mung bean chitinase was much less stable to changes in pH and temperature. Brassica LTP inhibited proliferation of hepatoma Hep G2 cells and breast cancer MCF 7 cells with an IC(50) of 5.8 and 1.6 µm, respectively, and the activity of HIV‐1 reverse transcriptase with an IC(50) of 4 µm. However, mung bean LTP and chitinase were devoid of antiproliferative and HIV‐1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activities. In contrast to the mung bean LTP, which exhibited antibacterial activity, Brassica LTP was inactive. All three antifungal peptides lacked mitogenic activity toward splenocytes. These results indicate that the two LTPs have more desirable activities than the chitinase and that there is a dissociation between the antifungal and other activities of these antifungal proteins.

DL0410 ((1,1′-([1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diyl) bis (3-(piperidin-1-yl) propan-1-one) dihydrochloride) is a multiple-target small molecule that has been found to reverse cognitive impairment in different animal models of AD. In this study we evaluated the cognition-improving effects of DL0410 in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and explored the underlying mechanisms. APP/PS1 transgenic mice were administered DL0410 (3, 10, 30 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), ig) for 2 months. We found that DL0410 administration significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits in both the nest-building and Morris water maze tests. In electrophysiological analysis of hippocampal slices, we showed that DL0410 administration significantly enhanced the field EPSP slope and HFS-induced LTP in CA1 area. Furthermore, we revealed that DL0410 administration significantly increased the phosphorylation of AKT and the activity of GSK-3β in the hippocampus and cortex. Moreover, DL0410 administration dose-dependently increased the expression level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the hippocampus and cortex. In addition, DL0410 dose-dependently decreased the neuronal loss by decreasing the production of Aβ deposition, inhibited glial overactivation, and the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. We conclude that DL0410 ameliorates cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by promoting synaptic transmission via activating the AKT/GSK-3β and MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and reducing neuronal loss.

Commercial platforms have enabled semi high-throughput behavioral analyses by automating animal tracking, yet they poorly recognize ethologically relevant behaviors and lack the flexibility to be employed in variable testing environments. Critical advances based on deep-learning and machine vision over the last couple of years now enable markerless tracking of individual body parts of freely moving rodents with high precision. Here, we compare the performance of commercially available platforms (EthoVision XT14, Noldus; TSE Multi-Conditioning System, TSE Systems) to cross-verified human annotation. We provide a set of videos—carefully annotated by several human raters—of three widely used behavioral tests (open field test, elevated plus maze, forced swim test). Using these data, we then deployed the pose estimation software DeepLabCut to extract skeletal mouse representations. Using simple post-analyses, we were able to track animals based on their skeletal representation in a range of classic behavioral tests at similar or greater accuracy than commercial behavioral tracking systems. We then developed supervised machine learning classifiers that integrate the skeletal representation with the manual annotations. This new combined approach allows us to score ethologically relevant behaviors with similar accuracy to humans, the current gold standard, while outperforming commercial solutions. Finally, we show that the resulting machine learning approach eliminates variation both within and between human annotators. In summary, our approach helps to improve the quality and accuracy of behavioral data, while outperforming commercial systems at a fraction of the cost.",2020-07-25,"Sturman, Oliver; von Ziegler, Lukas; Schläppi, Christa; Akyol, Furkan; Privitera, Mattia; Slominski, Daria; Grimm, Christina; Thieren, Laetitia; Zerbi, Valerio; Grewe, Benjamin; Bohacek, Johannes",Neuropsychopharmacology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5bf8f633d6e4848b9649dacae52918744af78cf0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7608249.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608249/,

Although unsubstantiated, the probable cause of bleeding was a chronic malabsorption of fat and the fat‐soluble vitamin K. When treated_with vitamin Ki per os, one cat's clotting times were only partially corrected. Since vitamin K, is actively absorbed in the proximal small intestine, the incomplete response of this case to orally administered vitamin K, was predictable. The infrequent occurrence of bleeding in animals with malabsorption is, in part, attributable to the ileal and colonic absorption of bacterially derived vitamin K(2). For this reason, nonspecific use of antibiotics in these animals is contraindicated. Since long‐chain, polyunsaturated fats impair vitamin K absorption, dietary fat given to animals with malasorption should be restricted to medium‐ and short‐chain, saturated fats. Vitamin K should be administered subcutaneously to these animals if prolonged clotting times or active bleeding is present, and routinely prior to surgery. Oral supplementation with vitamin K(3), which is absorbed in the colon and less lipid soluble than vitamin Ki, should be given to animals with malabsorption that are maintained as outpatients.

However, a lack of epidemiological data remains for this pathology, and the performances of the influenza-like illness (ILI) case definitions used for sentinel surveillance have never been evaluated in Senegal. This study aimed to i) assess the performance of three different ILI case definitions, adopted by the WHO, USA-CDC (CDC) and European-CDC (ECDC) and ii) identify clinical factors associated with a positive diagnosis for Influenza in order to develop an algorithm fitted for the Senegalese context. METHODS: All 657 patients with a febrile pathological episode (FPE) between January 2013 and December 2016 were followed in a cohort study in two rural villages in Senegal, accounting for 1653 FPE observations with nasopharyngeal sampling and influenza virus screening by rRT-PCR. For each FPE, general characteristics and clinical signs presented by patients were collected. Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for the three ILI case definitions were assessed using PCR result as the reference test. Associations between clinical signs and influenza infection were analyzed using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. Sore throat, arthralgia or myalgia were missing for children under 5 years. RESULTS: WHO, CDC and ECDC case definitions had similar sensitivity (81.0%; 95%CI: 77.0–85.0) and NPV (91.0%; 95%CI: 89.0–93.1) while the WHO and CDC ILI case definitions had the highest specificity (52.0%; 95%CI: 49.1–54.5) and PPV (32.0%; 95%CI: 30.0–35.0). These performances varied by age groups. In children < 5 years, the significant predictors of influenza virus infection were cough and nasal discharge. In patients from 5 years, cough, nasal discharge, sore throat and asthenia grade 3 best predicted influenza infection. The addition of “nasal discharge” as a symptom to the WHO case definition decreased sensitivity but increased specificity, particularly in the pediatric population. CONCLUSION: In summary, all three definitions studies (WHO, ECDC & CDC) have similar performance, even by age group.

METHODS: A total of 120 pigs were randomly divided into 6 groups (20 pigs per group). Four separate vaccine regimen groups were selected. Pigs from the four vaccinated groups were challenged with M. hyopneumoniae at 28 days old followed by a challenge of PRRSV or PCV2 at 49 days old. RESULTS: Regardless of PRRSV or PCV2 vaccination, pigs vaccinated with one of the M. hyopneumoniae vaccines at 7 days old had a significantly better growth performance over the whole length of the study compared to pigs vaccinated with a second M. hyopneumoniae vaccine at 21 days old. Vaccination of pigs with M. hyopneumoniae at 7 days and PRRSV at either 7, 14 or 21 days old resulted in significantly reduced PRRSV viremia and lung lesions compared to vaccination of pigs with M. hyopneumoniae and PRRSV at 21 days old. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of the PRRSV MLV vaccine is influenced by the different timing of M. hyopneumoniae vaccination whereas the efficacy of the PCV2 vaccine is not.

EVD outbreaks typically start from a single case of probable zoonotic transmission, followed by human-to-human transmission via direct contact or contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated fomites. EVD has a high case–fatality rate; it is characterized by fever, gastrointestinal signs and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Diagnosis requires a combination of case definition and laboratory tests, typically real-time reverse transcription PCR to detect viral RNA or rapid diagnostic tests based on immunoassays to detect EBOV antigens. Recent advances in medical countermeasure research resulted in the recent approval of an EBOV-targeted vaccine by European and US regulatory agencies. The results of a randomized clinical trial of investigational therapeutics for EVD demonstrated survival benefits from two monoclonal antibody products targeting the EBOV membrane glycoprotein.

The main purpose of this work is to describe its evolution using ultrasound measurements of muscular excursion and thickening fraction (TF). Single-center prospective study of 79 consecutive uncomplicated elective cardiac surgery patients, using motion-mode during quiet unassisted breathing. Excursion and TF were measured sequentially for each patient [pre-operative (D1), 1 day (D2) and 5 days (D3) after surgery]. Pre-operative median for right and left hemidiaphragmatic excursions were 1.8 (IQR 1.6 to 2.1) cm and 1.7 (1.4 to 2.0) cm, respectively. Pre-operative median right and left thickening fractions were 28 (19 to 36) % and 33 (22 to 51) %, respectively. At D2, there was a reduction in both excursion (right: 1.5 (1.1 to 1.8) cm, p < 0.001, left: 1.5 (1.1 to 1.8), p = 0.003) and thickening fractions (right: 20 (15 to 34) %, p = 0.021, left: 24 (17 to 39) %, p = 0.002), followed by a return to pre-operative values at D3. A positive moderate correlation was found between excursion and thickening fraction (Spearman’s rho 0.518 for right and 0.548 for left hemidiaphragm, p < 0.001). Interobserver reliability yielded a bias below 0.1 cm with limits of agreement (LOA) of ± 0.3 cm for excursion and − 2% with LOA of ± 21% for thickening fractions. After cardiac surgery, the evolution of diaphragmatic function is characterized by a transient impairment followed by a quick recovery. Although ultrasound diaphragmatic excursion and thickening fraction are correlated, excursion seems to be a more feasible and reproducible method in this population.

We found that PHO mutants expressing PHO84 and PHO5, even under high-P conditions, could take up phosphorus at twice the rate of the wild-type strain. The regulatory pathway for phosphorus accumulation in two wastewater treatment yeasts, Hansenula fabianii J640 and Hansenula anomala J224-1, was found to be similar to that in S. cerevisiae. We screened for mutants of these yeasts that constitutively expressed APase. Such mutants formed blue colonies on high phosphorus concentration agar plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (X-phosphate).

IFN-α is commonly used in hepatitis B therapy, but how it inhibits HBV is not fully understood. We screened 285 human interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) for anti-HBV activity using a cell-based assay, which revealed several anti-HBV ISGs. Among these ISGs, SAMD4A was the strongest suppressor of HBV replication. We found the binding site of SAMD4A in HBV RNA, which was a previously unidentified Smaug recognition region (SRE) sequence conserved in HBV variants. SAMD4A binds to the SRE site in viral RNA to trigger its degradation. The SAM domain in SAMD4A is critical for RNA binding and the C-terminal domain of SAMD4A is required for SAMD4A anti-HBV function. Human SAMD4B is a homolog of human SAMD4A but is not an ISG, and the murine genome encodes SAMD4. All these SAMD4 proteins suppressed HBV replication when overexpressed in vitro and in vivo. We also showed that knocking out the Samd4 gene in hepatocytes led to a higher level of HBV replication in mice and AAV-delivered SAMD4A expression reduced the virus titer in HBV-producing transgenic mice. In addition, a database analysis revealed a negative correlation between the levels of SAMD4A/B and HBV in patients.

SUBJECTS/METHODS: A retrospective case-series performed at the Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, USA. Electronically pulled data of 2444 surgeries revealed 147 surgeries on 133 very elderly patients. Chart review was conducted for all very elderly and corresponding control patients (75–84 years old). The first operated eyes of patients with final best-corrected visual acuity ≥20/40, axial length (AL) 22–26 mm, and implanted SN60WF IOL were included. Patients with ocular comorbidities and/or intra- or post-operative complications were excluded. Prediction errors of refractive outcome and percentage of eyes within ±0.50D and ±1.00D were compared between the groups for the Holladay 1 and Barrett Universal II (Barrett) formulas. Logistic regression analysis for achievement of ±1.00D was conducted. RESULTS: Final analysis included 90 eyes (n = 44, very elderly, n = 46, control patients). Median absolute refractive error (MedAE) with Holladay 1, but not Barrett formula, was significantly higher in the older group (p = 0.02 and p = 0.07, respectively).

Current methods for in vivo quantification of mutagenesis are limited because they rely on transgenic rodent systems that are low-throughput, expensive, prolonged, and do not fully represent other species such as humans. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a conceptually attractive alternative for detecting mutations in the DNA of any organism; however, the limit of resolution for standard NGS is poor. Technical error rates (∼1 × 10(−3)) of NGS obscure the true abundance of somatic mutations, which can exist at per-nucleotide frequencies ≤1 × 10(−7). Using duplex sequencing, an extremely accurate error-corrected NGS (ecNGS) technology, we were able to detect mutations induced by three carcinogens in five tissues of two strains of mice within 31 d following exposure. We observed a strong correlation between mutation induction measured by duplex sequencing and the gold-standard transgenic rodent mutation assay. We identified exposure-specific mutation spectra of each compound through trinucleotide patterns of base substitution. We observed variation in mutation susceptibility by genomic region, as well as by DNA strand. We also identified a primordial marker of carcinogenesis in a cancer-predisposed strain of mice, as evidenced by clonal expansions of cells carrying an activated oncogene, less than a month after carcinogen exposure. These findings demonstrate that ecNGS is a powerful method for sensitively detecting and characterizing mutagenesis and the early clonal evolutionary hallmarks of carcinogenesis.

Significantly, the less toxic cecropins have gained widespread attention for potential antibacterial agent development. However, the narrow activity spectrum and long sequence remain the primary limitations of this approach. In this study, we truncated and modified cecropin 4 (41 amino acids) by varying the charge and hydrophobicity balance to obtain smaller AMPs. The derivative peptide C18 (16 amino acids) demonstrated high antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as yeasts. Moreover, C18 demonstrated a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 µg/mL against the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and showed synergy with daptomycin with a fractional inhibition concentration index (FICI) value of 0.313. Similar to traditional cecropins, C18 altered the membrane potential, increased fluidity, and caused membrane breakage at 32 µg/mL. Importantly, C18 eliminated 99% persisters at 10 × MIC within 20 min and reduced the biofilm adherence by ~40% and 35% at 32 and 16 µg/mL. Besides, C18 possessed a strong binding ability with DNA at 7.8 μM and down-regulated the expression of virulence factor genes like agrA, fnb-A, and clf-1 by more than 5-fold (p < 0.05). Interestingly, in the Galleria mellonella model, C18 rescued more than 80% of larva infected with the MRSA throughout 120-h post-infection at a single dose of 8 mg/kg (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study provides a reference for the transformation of cecropin to derive small peptides and presents C18 as an attractive therapeutic candidate to be developed to treat severe MRSA infections.",2021-01-01,"Peng, Jian; Mishra, Biswajit; Khader, Rajamohammed; Felix, LewisOscar; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Antibiotics (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3657b4753cf6923ce21d6eabf39a687c606bc14c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7824259.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7824259/,

Despite the traumatic nature of witnessing gun violence, we have little knowledge of whether exposure to local gun violence is associated with higher risks of depression among mothers, whose symptoms of depression are likely to have spillover effects for kin. We examined the association between exposure to gun violence in mothers’ neighborhoods and their experiences of depression using longitudinal Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study data (n = 4587) in tandem with lagged outcome and fixed effect models. We find that mothers who witness at least one shooting in their neighborhoods or local communities exhibit more symptoms of depression and are 32–60% more likely to meet criteria for depression than mothers who do not witness a shooting. We also find that witnessing a shooting is associated with increases in parental aggravation, which is partially mediated by maternal depression. Given this and other previously documented spillover effects of mothers’ mental health on children and family members, these findings have important implications for mothers’ wellbeing and their kin. Further, we observe substantial racial and socioeconomic disparities in exposure to gun violence, suggesting that gun violence may heighten health disparities and drawing attention to the importance of providing mental health resources in communities that are most affected by gun violence.",2021-01-13,"Leibbrand, Christine; Rivara, Frederick; Rowhani-Rahbar, Ali",Prev Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/efcfc9c879dfc6fb6569db48962414b3381013b4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7805261.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7805261/,

(2) Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study involving a systematic random sampling method, using a sample of 230 parent/preschool child dyads. Among 230 parents, 24 were males and 206 were females (mean age 31.43 ± 5.82); among 230 children, 92 were boys and 138 were girls (mean age 4.82 ± 1.04) attending the pedodontics clinic, HUSM, who participated and met the inclusion criteria. A structured, self-administered oral health literacy questionnaire including sociodemographic factors was used in this study. A child’s oral examination was performed to check the dmft (decayed, missing, filled teeth) status. Statistical analysis was done using descriptive and Spearman’s correlation analysis and multivariate regression analysis. (3) Results: The mean dmft score of children in relation to the OHL level of parents showed a significant difference (p < 0.00). The mean dmft score of children in relation to the OHL level of parents showed the following relationships: Inadequate (7.49 ± 4.10) followed by marginal (3.28 ± 2.67) and then adequate (0.55 ± 1.55). The incidence of caries amongst children in relation to parental employment was more associated with unemployed parents (6.11 ± 4.43) than with employed parents (2.79 ± 3.65). The caries experience amongst children in relation to education of their parents revealed a significant difference (p < 0.001), and the mean dmft score was high amongst preschool children with primary school qualified parents (10.7 ± 4.10) followed by high school (7.04 ± 3.68), vocational (5.81 ± 3.57), diploma (2.61 ± 2.81), and university (1.29 ± 2.27), respectively. The results revealed a valid significant difference (negative correlation, r(s) = −0.753 **) between the OHL of parents with the dmft score of their preschool children.

Both proteins contain a bromodomain (BrD) adjacent to the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) catalytic domain, which serves as a promising drug target for cancers and immune system disorders. Several potent and selective small-molecule inhibitors targeting CBP BrD have been reported, but thus far small-molecule inhibitors targeting BrD outside of the BrD and extraterminal domain (BET) family are especially lacking. Here, we established and optimized a TR-FRET-based high-throughput screening platform for the CBP BrD and acetylated H4 peptide. Through an HTS assay against an in-house chemical library containing 20 000 compounds, compound DC_CP20 was discovered as a novel CBP BrD inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 744.3 nM. This compound bound to CBP BrD with a K(D) value of 4.01 μM in the surface plasmon resonance assay. Molecular modeling revealed that DC_CP20 occupied the Kac-binding region firmly through hydrogen bonding with the conserved residue N1168. At the celluslar level, DC_CP20 dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia MV4-11 cells with an IC(50) value of 19.2 μM and markedly downregulated the expression of the c-Myc in the cells. Taken together, the discovery of CBP BrD inhibitor DC_CP20 provides a novel chemical scaffold for further medicinal chemistry optimization and a potential chemical probe for CBP-related biological function research.

There are two penetration pathways: (1) through the faceseal leakage, and the (2) filter medium. This study aimed at differentiating the contributions of these two pathways for particles in the size range of 0.03–1 μm under actual breathing conditions. One N95 filtering facepiece respirator and one surgical mask commonly used in health care environments were tested on 25 subjects (matching the latest National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health fit testing panel) as the subjects performed conventional fit test exercises. The respirator and the mask were also tested with breathing manikins that precisely mimicked the prerecorded breathing patterns of the tested subjects. The penetration data obtained in the human subject- and manikin-based tests were compared for different particle sizes and breathing patterns. Overall, 5250 particle size- and exercise-specific penetration values were determined. For each value, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio was calculated to quantify the relative contributions of the two penetration pathways. The number of particles penetrating through the faceseal leakage of the tested respirator/mask far exceeded the number of those penetrating through the filter medium. For the N95 respirator, the excess was (on average) by an order of magnitude and significantly increased with an increase in particle size (p < 0.001): ∼7-fold greater for 0.04 μm, ∼10-fold for 0.1 μm, and ∼20-fold for 1 μm. For the surgical mask, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio ranged from 4.8 to 5.8 and was not significantly affected by the particle size for the tested submicrometer fraction. Facial/body movement had a pronounced effect on the relative contribution of the two penetration pathways. Breathing intensity and facial dimensions showed some (although limited) influence. Because most of the penetrated particles entered through the faceseal, the priority in respirator/mask development should be shifted from improving the efficiency of the filter medium to establishing a better fit that would eliminate or minimize faceseal leakage.",2010-07-22,"Grinshpun, Sergey A.; Haruta, Hiroki; Eninger, Robert M.; Reponen, Tiina; McKay, Roy T.; Lee, Shu-An",J Occup Environ Hyg,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9c2c75ca28fe06220b98a20bc59c84c4bb028e78.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196699.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196699/,

Our purpose was to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of MSC-derived therapies (MDTs) for ALI/ARDS in animal models. METHODS: A meta-analysis of MDTs for ALI/ARDS in animal trials was performed. PubMed and EMBASE were searched to screen relevant preclinical trials with a predetermined search strategy. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies that compared MDT with the ALI control group were included in our study. The pooled result derived from the comparison of the two groups suggested that MDT could significantly reduce the lung injury score (standardized mean difference (SMD) = − 4.02, 95% CI [− 5.28, − 2.23], P < 0.0001) and improve animal survival (OR = − 6.45, 95% CI [2.78, 14.97], P < 0.0001). MDT mitigated the infiltration of neutrophils in alveoli (SMD = − 3.38, 95% CI [− 4.58, − 2.18], P < 0.00001). MDT also reduced the wet-dry weight ratio of the lung (SMD = − 2.34, 95% CI [− 3.42, − 1.26], P < 0.0001) and the total protein in BALF (SMD = − 2.23, 95% CI [− 3.07, − 1.40], P < 0.00001). Furthermore, MDT was found to downregulate proinflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a and to upregulate anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10. CONCLUSION: MDT reduces lung injury and improves survival in animal ARDS models since it can ameliorate lung permeability, decrease inflammatory cell infiltration, downregulate proinflammatory mediators, and upregulate anti-inflammatory mediators.

The secondary aim was to explore whether the intervention was associated with clinically significant improvements to clinical and social variables known to co-occur with social anxiety. METHOD: A multidisciplinary team comprising of mental health clinicians, researchers, young adult fiction writers, a comic artist and young people with a lived experience of social anxiety developed the Entourage platform in collaboration. Entourage combines evidence-based therapeutic techniques for social anxiety with an engaging, social-media-based interface that allows users to build social connections, while also receiving expert clinical moderation and support from peer workers. Acceptability, feasibility and safety outcomes of Entourage were tested in a 12-week pilot study with 89 young people (48.3% male; age M = 19.8 years, SD = 3.3 years). Eligible participants were recruited via liaison with four headspace early-intervention centres in north-western Melbourne. RESULTS: 56.8% of the sample reported social anxiety symptoms in the severe or very severe range at baseline. Results demonstrated the Entourage intervention was feasible, safe, and potentially acceptable, with 98.6% of participants reporting they would recommend Entourage to another young person experiencing social anxiety. Usage results were also comparable across male and non-male participants. Results showed that young people reliably and significantly improved on clinical and social variables. In particular, young males showed a clinically significant improvement on social anxiety symptoms (d = 0.79, p < .001), depression (d = 0.71, p < .001), belongingness (d = 0.58, p = .001), increased feelings of social connectedness (d = 0.46, p = .004) and decreased loneliness (d = 0.46, p = .006). Non-male participants also experienced a significant increase in social connectedness (d = 0.76, p < .001), alongside reduced social anxiety (d = 0.78, p < .001) and experiential avoidance (d = 0.81, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Entourage is a highly engaging and potentially effective intervention that represents a novel combination of features designed both to reduce social anxiety symptoms and improve social connection among young people. Entourage demonstrated some acceptability, feasibility and safety, with encouraging benefits to clinical and social variables. Entourage also showed favorable results for the engagement and support of young men with social anxiety symptoms.",2020-05-08,"Rice, Simon; O'Bree, Bridget; Wilson, Michael; McEnery, Carla; Lim, Michelle H.; Hamilton, Matthew; Gleeson, John; Bendall, Sarah; D'Alfonso, Simon; Russon, Penni; Valentine, Lee; Cagliarini, Daniela; Howell, Simmone; Miles, Christopher; Pearson, Marc; Nicholls, Laura; Garland, Nicola; Mullen, Edward; McGorry, Patrick D.; Alvarez-Jimenez, Mario",Internet Interv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/947094dd89d4d1a981d6106d3031ae8bc85f8f12.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7232094.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7232094/,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study of 101 PCNSL patients admitted to 3 ICUs over a two-decade period. RESULTS: Acute respiratory failure, mainly secondary to aspiration pneumonia and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, was the leading reason for ICU admission (33%). Aspiration pneumonia was more common in patients with brainstem tumor (67% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), whereas patients with intracranial hypertension were more frequently admitted for coma without seizures (61% vs. 9%, p = 0.004). Hospital and 6-month mortality were 47% and 53%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, admission for coma without seizures (OR 7.28), cancer progression (OR 3.47), mechanical ventilation (OR 6.58) and vasopressors (OR 4.07) were associated with higher 6-month mortality. Karnofsky performance status prior to ICU admission was independently associated with lower 6-month mortality (OR 0.96). DISCUSSION: Six-month survival of PCNSL patients admitted to the ICU appears to be relatively favorable (around 50%) and the presence of PCNSL alone is not a relevant criterion for ICU refusal. Predictive factors of mortality may help clinicians to make optimal triage decisions.

The causative agent is the SVC virus (SVCV), a member of the Sprivivirus genus, Rhabdoviridae family, and a List 1 pathogen notifiable by the World Organization for Animal Health. This study describes the diagnosis of an SVCV pathogen isolated in October 2015 from wild common carp inhabiting a natural lagoon in central Mexico. While neither an epidemic nor fish mortalities were reported, the collected killed specimens exhibited clinical signs of disease (e.g., exopthalmia, moderate abdominal distension and haemorrhaging, as well as internal haemorrhages and adhesions). Histological results of injuries were consistent with the pathology caused by SVCV. This finding was supported by the isolation of a virus in EPC and BF‐2 cells and subsequent RT‐PCR confirmation of SVCV. The phylogenetic analyses of partial SVCV glycoprotein gene sequences classified the isolates into the Ia genogroup. These findings make this the first report of SVCV detection in Mexico, extending the southern geographical range of SVCV within North America. However, since this pathogen was detected in fish inhabiting a natural body of water without tributaries or effluents, it is difficult to estimate the risk of SVCV for other wild/feral cohabitating cyprinid species in the lagoon.

It is an endemic most commonly found at South Asia and has first emerged in Malaysia in 1998. Bats are found to be the main reservoir for this virus, causing disease in both humans and animals. The last outbreak has occurred in May 2018 in Kerala. It is characterized by high pathogenicity and fatality rates which varies from 40% to 70% depending on the severity of the disease and on the availability of adequate healthcare facilities. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs available for NiV disease and the treatment is just supportive. Clinical presentations for this virus range from asymptomatic infection to fatal encephalitis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at predicting an effective epitope-based vaccine against glycoprotein G of Nipah henipavirus, using immunoinformatics approaches. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Glycoprotein G of the Nipah virus sequence was retrieved from NCBI. Different prediction tools were used to analyze the epitopes, namely, BepiPred-2.0: Sequential B Cell Epitope Predictor for B cell and T cell MHC classes II and I. Then, the proposed peptides were docked using Autodock 4.0 software program. Results and Conclusions. The two peptides TVYHCSAVY and FLIDRINWI have showed a very strong binding affinity to MHC class I and MHC class II alleles.

METHODS: This single-center, retrospective, observational study included the perioperative data of 123 patients who underwent free-flap reconstruction of the head and neck following oncological surgery. Patients were divided into the following two groups according to whether they received ANH: ANH group and non-ANH group. We investigated whether ANH can reduce the need for perioperative ABT using propensity score-adjusted logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients, 113 patients were assessed; 57 patients were in the ANH group and 56 patients were in the non-ANH group.

In this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying downregulation of TMEM16A CaCC activity during hypertension. In cultured basilar artery smooth muscle cells (BASMCs) isolated from 2k2c renohypertesive rats, treatment with angiotensin II (0.125−1 μM) dose-dependently increased endophilin A2 levels and decreased TMEM16A expression. Similar phenomenon was observed in basilar artery isolated from 2k2c rats. We then used whole-cell recording to examine whether endophilin A2 could regulate TMEM16A CaCC activity in BASMCs and found that knockdown of endophilin A2 significantly enhanced CaCC activity, whereas overexpression of endophilin A2 produced the opposite effect. Overexpression of endophilin A2 did not affect the TMEM16A mRNA level, but markedly decreased TMEM16A protein level in BASMCs by inducing ubiquitination and autophagy of TMEM16A. Ubiquitin-binding receptor p62 (SQSTM1) could bind to ubiquitinated TMEM16A and resulted in a process of TMEM16A proteolysis in autophagosome/lysosome.

A systematic review was performed in order to investigate the link between puberty and back pain, using some Bradford Hill criteria for causality. OBJECTIVES: We sought to obtain answers to the following questions: 1) Is there an association between puberty and back pain? If so, how strong is this association? And do the results remain unchanged also when controlling for age and sex? 2) Are the results of the studies consistent? 3) Is there a dose–response, showing a link between the increasing stages of puberty and the subsequent prevalence of back pain? 4) Is there a temporal link between puberty and back pain? DESIGN: A systematic critical literature review. METHODS: Systematic searches were made in March 2014 in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO including longitudinal or cross-sectional studies on back pain for subjects <19 years, written in French or English. The review process followed the AMSTAR recommendations. Interpretation was made using some of the Bradford-Hill criteria for causality. RESULTS: Four articles reporting five studies were included, two of which were longitudinal. 1) Some studies show a weak and others a strong positive association between puberty and back pain, which remains after controlling for age and sex; 2) Results were consistent across the studies; 3) There was a linear increase of back pain according to the stage of puberty 4) Temporality has not been sufficiently studied. CONCLUSION: All our criteria for causality were fulfilled or somewhat fulfilled indicating the possibility of a causal link between puberty and back pain. Future research should focus on specific hypotheses, for example investigating if there could be a hormonal or a biomechanical aspect to the development of back pain at this time of life.

Even if rescued with central aortic repair, some patients develop permanent postoperative neurological deficiency postoperatively. We recently introduced direct common carotid artery perfusion for acute type A aortic dissection involving the common carotid artery. This study introduced this technique to prevent postoperative neurological deficiency by comparing brain protection strategies. METHODS: Among 91 acute type A aortic dissection patients treated at our hospital during August 2015–October 2020, the common carotid artery was involved in 19 (21%), which had > 90% stenosis in either of the carotid arteries on preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Twelve patients underwent conventional selective cerebral perfusion during August 2015–December 2018 and seven patients underwent direct carotid artery perfusion during January 2019–October 2020. We assessed patient characteristics, surgical courses, clinical outcomes, and neurological outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age was 69 (range 39–84) years; 17 patients were male (89%). Eight patients (42%) had neurological symptoms. Concomitant procedures, postoperative neurological symptoms, and late mortality were significantly associated with conventional selective cerebral perfusion. Five selective cerebral perfusion patients experienced worsened neurological symptoms and two died of broad cerebral ischemia. No direct carotid artery perfusion patient died during hospitalization or experienced worsened neurological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Direct carotid artery perfusion may be useful in aortic dissection with brain ischemia because it does not aggravate neurological symptoms and is not associated with intraoperative cerebral infarction. However, it may be ineffective when cerebral infarction has already developed.",2021-04-02,"Sugiyama, Kayo; Watanuki, Hirotaka; Futamura, Yasuhiro; Okada, Masaho; Oiwa, Tatsunori; Makino, Satoshi; Matsuyama, Katsuhiko",Gen Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/177920da7b9c09b6e26c1c604a78ac1da8d5cdc9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8017433.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8017433/,

Lipid biomarkers including cholesterol are dynamically regulated during sepsis and predict short-term outcomes. In this study, we investigated the predictive ability of lipid biomarkers for physical function and long-term mortality after sepsis. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of sepsis patients admitted to a surgical intensive-care unit (ICU) within 24 h of sepsis bundle initiation. Samples were obtained at enrollment for lipid biomarkers. Multivariate regression models determined independent risk factors predictive of poor performance status (Zubrod score of 3/4/5) or survival at 1-year follow-up. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The study included 104 patients with surgical sepsis. Enrollment total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) levels were lower, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels were higher for patients with poor performance status at 1 year. A similar trend was seen in comparisons based on 1-year mortality, with HDL-C and ApoA-I levels being lower and MPO levels being higher in non-survivors. However, multivariable logistic regression only identified baseline Zubrod and initial SOFA score as significant independent predictors of poor performance status at 1 year. Multivariable Cox regression modeling for 1-year survival identified high Charlson comorbidity score, low ApoA-I levels, and longer vasopressor duration as predictors of mortality over 1-year post-sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: In this surgical sepsis study, lipoproteins were not found to predict poor performance status at 1 year. ApoA-I levels, Charlson comorbidity scores, and duration of vasopressor use predicted 1 year survival. These data implicate cholesterol and lipoproteins as contributors to the underlying pathobiology of sepsis.

Insecticide synergists may help control insecticide‐resistant populations. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is such a synergist; it has been incorporated into pyrethroid‐LLINs to form pyrethroid‐PBO nets, which are currently produced by five LLIN manufacturers and, following a recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2017, are being included in distribution campaigns. This review examines epidemiological and entomological evidence on the addition of PBO to pyrethroid nets on their efficacy. OBJECTIVES: To compare effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets currently in commercial development or on the market with effects of their non‐PBO equivalent in relation to: 1. malaria parasite infection (prevalence or incidence); and 2. entomological outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts, and two clinical trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) up to 25 September 2020. We contacted organizations for unpublished data. We checked the reference lists of trials identified by these methods. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included experimental hut trials, village trials, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex or the Anopheles funestus group. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed each trial for eligibility, extracted data, and determined the risk of bias for included trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion with a third review author. We analysed data using Review Manager 5 and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria: 10 experimental hut trials, four village trials, and two cluster‐RCTs (cRCTs). Three trials are awaiting classification, and four trials are ongoing. Two cRCTs examined the effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on parasite prevalence in people living in areas with highly pyrethroid‐resistant mosquitoes (< 30% mosquito mortality in discriminating dose assays). At 21 to 25 months post intervention, parasite prevalence was lower in the intervention arm (odds ratio (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.95; 2 trials, 2 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). In highly pyrethroid‐resistant areas, unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets led to higher mosquito mortality compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (risk ratio (RR) 1.84, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.11; 14,620 mosquitoes, 5 trials, 9 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence) and lower blood feeding success (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.71; 14,000 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 8 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). However, in comparisons of washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets to washed LLINs, we do not know if PBO nets had a greater effect on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.63; 10,268 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 5 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence), although the washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets did decrease blood‐feeding success compared to standard‐LLINs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92; 9674 mosquitoes, 3 trials, 4 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). In areas where pyrethroid resistance is moderate (31% to 60% mosquito mortality), mosquito mortality was higher with unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.11; 751 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), but there was little to no difference in effects on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11; 652 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we found little to no evidence for higher mosquito mortality or reduced blood feeding (mortality: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.54; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison, low‐certainty evidence; blood feeding success: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.13; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison; low‐certainty evidence). In areas where pyrethroid resistance is low (61% to 90% mosquito mortality), studies reported little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.57; 948 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), and we do not know if there was any effect on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.11; 948 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we do not know if there was any difference in mosquito mortality (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.04; 1022 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence) or on blood feeding (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.33; 1022 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). In areas where mosquito populations are susceptible to insecticides (> 90% mosquito mortality), there may be little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.26; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). This is similar for washed nets (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). We do not know if unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets had any effect on the blood‐feeding success of susceptible mosquitoes (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.22; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). The same applies to washed nets (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.91; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). In village trials comparing pyrethroid‐PBO nets to LLINs, there was no difference in sporozoite rate (4 trials, 5 comparisons) nor in mosquito parity (3 trials, 4 comparisons). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In areas of high insecticide resistance, pyrethroid‐PBO nets have greater entomological and epidemiological efficacy compared to standard LLINs, with sustained reduction in parasite prevalence, higher mosquito mortality and reduction in mosquito blood feeding rates 21 to 25 months post intervention. Questions remain about the durability of PBO on nets, as the impact of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on mosquito mortality was not sustained over 20 washes in experimental hut trials, and epidemiological data on pyrethroid‐PBO nets for the full intended three‐year life span of the nets is not available. Little evidence is available to support greater entomological efficacy of pyrethroid‐PBO nets in areas where mosquitoes show lower levels of resistance to pyrethroids.",2021-05-24,"Gleave, Katherine; Lissenden, Natalie; Chaplin, Marty; Choi, Leslie; Ranson, Hilary",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/01299b6aed07833b957fc27f41b6129afe7b121a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8142305.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8142305/,

The negative sequela of prenatal comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) has been suggested to be higher than that of anxiety or depression alone. CAD increases the odds of preterm birth, low birth weight, prolonged labor, operative deliveries, postpartum psychiatric disorders and long term cognitive impairment for the newborn. Despite its significant ill consequences, there is a dearth of studies in low-and middle-income countries. So far, to the best of our knowledge, no study assessed the prevalence of CAD in Ethiopia. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess CAD and associated factors among pregnant women in Arba Minch Zuria district, Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 676 pregnant women from January 01 to November 30, 2019. Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scales were used to assess depression and anxiety respectively. The data were collected electronically using an open data kit (ODK) collect android application and analyzed using Stata version 15.0. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were carried out to identify factors associated with CAD using binary logistic regression. Statistical significance was set at p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 667 women were involved. The prevalence of CAD was 10.04% [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.76, 12.33].

Medical records were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Among the 700 neonates with NARDS who needed invasive ventilation, 501 (71.6%) received CMV, while 199 (28.4%) received HFOV. One-to-one propensity score matching (127:127) was used to match the baseline characteristics of patients who received CMV and HFOV. The results showed that birth weight and oxygenation index (OI) were independently associated with mortality in the multivariate logistic regression. No significant differences were observed in mortality or the incidence of BPD between the two groups. The incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and ventilation-free days were significantly lower in the HFOV group than in the CMV group (3.9 vs 11.80%, p=0.02; 15.226 vs 20.967 days, p=0.01). There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding other secondary outcomes. Conclusion: HFOV was associated with a decreased incidence of IVH in infants with NARDS compared with CMV.

Tools to support efficient resource distribution are required. AIM: To investigate whether a person-centred e-health (Target-D) platform matching depression care to symptom severity prognosis can improve depressive symptoms relative to usual care. DESIGN AND SETTING: Stratified individually randomised controlled trial in 14 general practices in Melbourne, Australia, from April 2016 to February 2019. In total, 1868 participants aged 18–65 years who had current depressive symptoms; internet access; no recent change to antidepressant; no current antipsychotic medication; and no current psychological therapy were randomised (1:1) via computer-generated allocation to intervention or usual care. METHOD: The intervention was an e-health platform accessed in the GP waiting room, comprising symptom feedback, priority-setting, and prognosis-matched management options (online self-help, online guided psychological therapy, or nurse-led collaborative care). Management options were flexible, neither participants nor staff were blinded, and there were no substantive protocol deviations. The primary outcome was depressive symptom severity (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) at 3 months. RESULTS: In intention to treat analysis, estimated between- arm difference in mean PHQ-9 scores at 3 months was −0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] = −1.45 to −0.31) favouring the intervention, and −0.59 at 12 months (95% CI = −1.18 to 0.01); standardised effect sizes of −0.16 (95% CI = −0.26 to −0.05) and −0.10 (95% CI = −0.21 to 0.002), respectively.

The composition of these products is usually decomposed. However, some substances are not easily broken down and gradually become environmental pollutants. In addition, these substances may cause bioaccumulation, since the substances can be fragmented into micro- and nanoparticles. These particles or their interactions with other toxic matter circulate in humans via the food chain or air. Whether these micro- and nanoparticles interfere with extracellular vesicles (EVs) due to their similar sizes is unclear. Micro- and nanoparticles (MSs and NSs) induce several cell responses and are engulfed by cells depending on their size, for example, particulate matter with a diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5). Autophagy is a mechanism by which pathogens are destroyed in cells. Some artificial materials are not easily decomposed in organisms. How do these cells or tissues respond? In addition, autophagy operates through two pathways (increasing cell death or cell survival) in tumorigenesis. Many MSs and NSs have been found that induce autophagy in various cells and tissues. As a result, this review focuses on how these particles interfere with cells and tissues.

The development of atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of approximately 50% of all deaths in westernized societies. Countless studies have aimed to improve therapeutic approaches for atherosclerosis treatment; however, it remains high on the global list of challenges toward healthy and long lives. Some patients with familial hypercholesterolemia could not get intended LDL-C goals even with high doses of traditional therapies such as statins, with many of them being unable to tolerate statins because of the harsh side effects. Furthermore, even in patients achieving target LDL-C levels, the residual risk of traditional therapies is still significant thus highlighting the necessity of ongoing research for more effective therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects.

Determining the key actors and contents of the prevailing biomedical research agenda,10.1371/journal.pone.0249661,PMC8026021,33826657,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: Conflicts of interest in biomedical research can influence research results and drive research agendas away from public health priorities. Previous agenda-setting studies share two shortfalls: they only account for direct connections between academic institutions and firms, as well as potential bias based on researchers’ personal beliefs. This paper’s goal is to determine the key actors and contents of the prevailing health and biomedical sciences (HBMS) research agenda, overcoming these shortfalls. METHODS: We performed a bibliometric and lexical analysis of 95,415 scientific articles published between 1999 and 2018 in the highest impact factor journals within HBMS, using the Web of Science database and the CorText platform. HBMS’s prevailing knowledge network of institutions was proxied with network maps where nodes represent affiliations and edges the most frequent co-authorships. The content of the prevailing HBMS research agenda was depicted through network maps of prevalent multi-terms found in titles, keywords, and abstracts. RESULTS: The HBMS research agendas of large private firms and leading academic institutions are intertwined. The prevailing HBMS agenda is mostly based on molecular biology (40% of the most frequent multi-terms), with an inclination towards cancer and cardiovascular research (15 and 8% of the most frequent multi-terms, respectively). Studies on pathogens and biological vectors related to recent epidemics are marginal (1% of the most frequent multi-terms). Content of the prevailing HBMS research agenda prioritizes research on pharmacological intervention over research on socio-environmental factors influencing disease onset or progression and overlooks, among others, the study of infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmaceutical corporations contribute to set HBMS’s prevailing research agenda, which is mainly focused on a few diseases and research topics. A more balanced research agenda, together with epistemological approaches that consider socio-environmental factors associated with disease spreading, could contribute to being better prepared to prevent and treat more diverse pathologies and to improve overall health outcomes.",2021-04-07,"Testoni, Federico E.; García Carrillo, Mercedes; Gagnon, Marc-André; Rikap, Cecilia; Blaustein, Matías",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/fe75a3a3b1a7c82485433f73da2c438ca5078c29.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8026021.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8026021/,

Despite the recommendation by WHO and OIE to use the direct immunofluorescence test as standard method, molecular diagnostic assays like reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) are increasing as a confirmatory method. However, both technologies are inaccessible in resource-limited settings. Moreover, the available point-of-need molecular assay is of poor detection limit for African strains. Herein, we developed a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay as potential point-of-need diagnostic tool for rapid detection of various strains of rabies virus including locally isolated African strains. The sensitivity and specificity of the method was evaluated using a molecular RNA standard and different Rabies-related viruses belonging to the Rhabdoviridea family, respectively. The RABV-RPA performances were evaluated on isolates representative of the existing diversity and viral dilutions spiked in non-neural clinical specimen. The results were compared with RT-qPCR as a gold standard. The RABV-RPA detected down to 4 RNA molecules per reaction in 95% of the cases in less than 10 min. The RABV-RPA assay is highly specific as various RABV isolates were identified, but no amplification was observed for other member of the Rhabdoviridea family. The sample background did not affect the performance of the RABV-RPA as down to 11 RNA molecules were identified, which is similar to the RT-qPCR results.

The composition of red wine includes several compounds, such as the phytoestrogen resveratrol, that exert these beneficial effects, although not all the mechanisms by which they act are known. Our aim was to study the effect of red wine consumption on longevity-related genes in controlled human populations, such as cloistered nuns. We found that the expression of catalase, manganese-superoxide dismutase, Sirt1, and p53 was increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after 14 days of moderate red wine consumption. This increase was accompanied by an enhanced metabolic wellness: fatty acids, cholesterol, branched chain amino acids (isoleucine and leucine), ketone bodies (acetoacetate), bacterial co-metabolites (trimethylamine), and cellular antioxidants (taurine) contributed to a change in metabolic profile after moderate red wine consumption by the nuns. No serious unwanted side effects were observed. Finally, we tested the effect of moderate red wine consumption on longevity in a controlled animal population, such as D. melanogaster, and found that it increased average life span by 7%.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the nature and practice of informational counselling by audiologists. METHOD: This study was descriptive in nature and adopted a survey design to obtain information on the current practices of informational counselling from the perspective of parents and primary caregivers. Ninety-seven face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted across KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis using Nvivo software were conducted. RESULTS: The majority of the parents reported receiving some form of informational counselling. However, the information provided by audiologists was considered to be biased as it included a favoured communication option, school and rehabilitative technology. There was a lack of information related to aural rehabilitation and family-centred intervention. The provision of all communication options, school options and rehabilitative technology were identified as gaps that contribute to an unfavourable decision-making process.

Despite increased attention to them over the past decade, progress toward addressing NCDs has been slow. A lack of bold policy commitments has been suggested as one of the contributors to limited progress in NCD prevention and management. However, the policies of key global actors (bilateral, multilateral, and not-for-profit organisations) have been understudied. METHODS: This study aimed to map the key global actors investing in action regarding NCDs and review their policies to examine the articulation of priorities regarding NCDs. Narrative synthesis of 70 documents and 31 policy papers was completed, and related to data collated from the Global Health Data Visualisation Tool. RESULTS: In 2019 41% of development assistance for health committed to NCDs came from private philanthropies, while that for other global health priorities from this source was just 20%. Through a range of channels, bilateral donors were the other major source of NCD funding (contributing 41% of NCD funding). The UK and the US were the largest bilateral investors in NCDs, each contributing 8%. However, NCDs are still under-prioritised within bilateral portfolios – receiving just 0.48% of US funding and 1.66% of the UK. NGOs were the key channels of funding for NCDs, spending 48% of the funds from donors in 2019. The reviewed literature generally focused on NCD policies of WHO, with policies of multilateral and bilateral donors given limited attention. The analysis of policies indicated a limited prioritisation of NCDs in policy documents. NCDs are framed in the policies as a barrier to economic growth, poverty reduction, and health system sustainability. Bilateral donors prioritise prevention, while multilateral actors offer policy options for NCD prevention and care. Even where stated as a priority, however, funding allocations are not aligned. CONCLUSION: The growing threat of NCDs and their drivers are increasingly recognised. However, global actors’ policy priorities and funding allocations need to align better to address these NCD threats. Given the level of their investment and engagement, more research is needed into the role of private philanthropies and NGOs in this area.

This study examines the difference in vascular density, myocardial perfusion, molecular signaling, and gene expression between normal diet (ND) and high fat diet (HFD) groups at baseline and following intramyocardial injection of EVs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Intact male Yorkshire swine fed either an ND (n=17) or HFD (n=14) underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor on the left circumflex coronary artery. Subsequently, animals received either intramyocardial injection of vehicle‐saline as controls; (ND‐controls n=7, HFD‐controls, n=6) or EVs; (ND‐EVs n=10, HFD‐EVs n=8) into the ischemic territory. Five weeks later, myocardial function, perfusion, vascular density, cell signaling, and gene expression were examined. EVs improved indices of myocardial contractile function, myocardial perfusion, and arteriogenesis in both dietary cohorts. Interestingly, quantification of alpha smooth muscle actin demonstrated higher basal arteriolar density in HFD swine compared with their ND counterparts; whereas EVs were associated with increased CD31‐labeled endothelial cell density only in the ND tissue, which approached significance. Levels of total endothelial nitric oxide synthase, FOXO1 (forkhead box protein O1) , transforming growth factor‐β, phosphorylated VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2), and phosphorylated MAPK ERK1/ERK2 (mitogen‐activated protein kinase) were higher in ischemic myocardial lysates from ND‐controls compared with HFD‐controls. Conversely, HFD‐control tissue showed increased expression of phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase, phosphorylated FOXO1, VEGFR2, and MAPK ERK1/ERK2 with respect to ND‐controls. Preliminary gene expression studies indicate differential modulation of transcriptional activity by EVs between the 2 dietary cohorts.

Transcriptional orchestrators of this recovery process represent an appealing target for treatment design. We previously identified Prdm (positive regulatory domain-containing protein) 16 as an arterial-specific endothelial transcription factor but its in vivo role in arteries remains completely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To unravel the role of Prdm16 in arteries under physiological and pathological conditions, more specifically during peripheral artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Within the vasculature, Prdm16 expression was strictly confined to arterial endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Heterozygous loss of Prdm16 caused a modest reduction of the inner arterial diameter and smooth muscle cell coating without compromising vasomotor function. Upon femoral artery ligation, Prdm16(+/−) mice featured significantly impaired flow recovery to ischemic limbs. This impairment was recapitulated in mice with a Prdm16 deletion specifically in endothelial cells (EC-Prdm16(−/−)) but not smooth muscle cells. Structural collateral remodeling was normal in both Prdm16(+/−) and EC-Prdm16(−/−) mice, but significant endothelial dysfunction postligation was present in EC-Prdm16(−/−) mice as evidenced by impaired endothelial-dependent relaxation. Upon ligation, endothelial Prdm16 deficiency altered the expression of genes encoding endothelial cell function regulators, many related to nitric oxide bioavailability and Ca(2+) homeostasis. Accordingly, Prdm16 overexpression in cultured endothelial cells affected both total cellular Ca(2+) levels and store-operated Ca(2+) entry. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that Prdm16 is indispensable for arterial flow recovery under pathological challenge not because it affects structural remodeling but due to its role in maintaining endothelial function. It, therefore, represents an appealing target for designing novel therapeutic strategies for no-option patients with peripheral artery disease.",2021-04-27,"Craps, Sander; Van Wauwe, Jore; De Moudt, Sofie; De Munck, Dorien; Leloup, Arthur J.A.; Boeckx, Bram; Vervliet, Tim; Dheedene, Wouter; Criem, Nathan; Geeroms, Carla; Jones, Elizabeth A.V.; Zwijsen, An; Lambrechts, Diether; Fransen, Paul; Beerens, Manu; Luttun, Aernout",Circ Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/cc5458e3cf44e2bfd0bae50dadc5faa3965d15db.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8221541.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8221541/,

ECGs beat morphologies, beat durations, and amplitudes vary from subject to subject and diseases to diseases. Therefore, ECG morphology-based modeling has long-standing research interests. This work aims to develop a simplified ECG model based on a minimum number of parameters that could correctly represent ECG morphology in different cardiac dysrhythmias. A simple mathematical model based on the sum of two Gaussian functions is proposed. However, fitting more than one Gaussian function in a deterministic way has accuracy and localization problems. To solve these fitting problems, two hybrid optimization methods have been developed to select the optimal ECG model parameters. The first method is the combination of an approximation and global search technique (ApproxiGlo), and the second method is the combination of an approximation and multi-start search technique (ApproxiMul). The proposed model and optimization methods have been applied to real ECGs in different cardiac dysrhythmias, and the effectiveness of the model performance was measured in time, frequency, and the time-frequency domain. The model fit different types of ECG beats representing different cardiac dysrhythmias with high correlation coefficients (>0.98). Compared to the nonlinear fitting method, ApproxiGlo and ApproxiMul are 3.32 and 7.88 times better in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), respectively. Regarding optimization, the ApproxiMul performs better than the ApproxiGlo method in many metrics. Different uses of this model are possible, such as a syntactic ECG generator using a graphical user interface has been developed and tested. In addition, the model can be used as a lossy compression with a variable compression rate. A compression ratio of 20:1 can be achieved with 1 kHz sampling frequency and 75 beats per minute. These optimization methods can be used in different engineering fields where the sum of Gaussians is used.",2021-02-26,"Awal, Md.

The CLSI reference broth microdilution method was used to determine in vitro susceptibility of C/T and comparators against isolates of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales. RESULTS: C/T inhibited 96.0% of P. aeruginosa (n = 1237) at its susceptible MIC breakpoint (≤4 μg/ml), including > 85% of meropenem-nonsusceptible and piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T)-nonsusceptible isolates and 76.2% of MDR isolates. Comparator agents demonstrated lower activity than C/T against P. aeruginosa: meropenem (74.8% susceptible), cefepime (79.2%), ceftazidime (78.5%), P/T (74.4%), and levofloxacin (63.1%). C/T was equally active against ICU (96.0% susceptible) and non-ICU (96.7%) isolates of P. aeruginosa. C/T inhibited 91.8% of Enterobacterales (n = 1938) at its susceptible MIC breakpoint (≤2 μg/ml); 89.5% of isolates were susceptible to cefepime and 88.0% susceptible to P/T. 67.1 and 86.5% of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) screen-positive isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 85) and Escherichia coli (n = 74) and 49.6% of MDR Enterobacterales were susceptible to C/T. C/T was equally active against ICU (91.3% susceptible) and non-ICU (92.6%) Enterobacterales isolates. CONCLUSION: Data from the current study support the use of C/T as an important treatment option for lower respiratory tract infections including those caused by MDR P. aeruginosa.

To overcome these challenges, operational and outcome-oriented tools that enable animal health and human health services to work specifically on their collaboration are required. While international capacity and assessment frameworks such as the IHR-MEF (International Health Regulations—Monitoring and Evaluation Framework) and the OIE PVS (Performance of Veterinary Services) Pathway exist, a tool and process that could assess and strengthen the interactions between human and animal health sectors was needed. Through a series of six phased pilots, the IHR-PVS National Bridging Workshop (NBW) method was developed and refined. The NBW process gathers human and animal health stakeholders and follows seven sessions, scheduled across three days. The outputs from each session build towards the next one, following a structured process that goes from gap identification to joint planning of corrective measures. The NBW process allows human and animal health sector representatives to jointly identify actions that support collaboration while advancing evaluation goals identified through the IHR-MEF and the OIE PVS Pathway.

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a meta-analysis of in vitro and in vivo studies investigating bioeffects of MMWs at low exposure levels. METHODS: We identified 107 in vitro and in vivo studies investigating MMWs and biological effects in which the power density employed has been below 100 W/m(2), which is below the current standards for occupational local exposures. Where possible, we estimated the magnitude of the principal effect reported or set this magnitude to zero in studies reporting no significant effects. We also estimated the quality of the studies, based on a methodology used in previous analyses. RESULTS: We show a negative correlation between effect size and both power density and specific absorption rate. There was also a significant negative correlation between effect size and quality score. A multivariate analysis revealed that there is an increase in the effect size for certain biological systems being investigated and laboratories in which the work was carried out whilst the quality score for some of these tends to be low. We note that many of the studies were motivated by a desire to elucidate the possible mechanisms in therapeutic devices rather than assessing the safety of telecommunications systems. Finally, it appears that the presence or absence of modulation does not influence the reported effect size. SIGNIFICANCE: Many of the findings of this meta-analysis have not been reported before and have important implications for overall interpretation of in vitro and in vivo data.

Because imported cases are necessary drivers of outbreaks in non-endemic settings, predicting measles outbreaks in the US depends on predicting imported cases. To assess the predictability of imported measles cases, we performed a regression of imported measles cases in the US against an inflow variable that combines air travel data with international measles surveillance data. To understand the contribution of each data type to these predictions, we repeated the regression analysis with alternative versions of the inflow variable that replaced each data type with averaged values and with versions of the inflow variable that used modeled inputs. We assessed the performance of these regression models using correlation, coverage probability, and area under the curve statistics, including with resampling and cross-validation. Our regression model had good predictive ability with respect to the presence or absence of imported cases in a given state in a given year (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.78) and the magnitude of imported cases (Pearson correlation = 0.84). By comparing alternative versions of the inflow variable averaging over different inputs, we found that both air travel data and international surveillance data contribute to the model’s ability to predict numbers of imported cases and individually contribute to its ability to predict the presence or absence of imported cases. Predicted sources of imported measles cases varied considerably across years and US states, depending on which countries had high measles activity in a given year. Our results emphasize the importance of the relationship between global connectedness and the spread of measles.

However, no studies have documented the oral hygiene features present in patients who present with dysphagia. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the oral hygiene problems of adults admitted to a sub-acute rehabilitation hospital and who presented with dysphagia. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was conducted, during which 40 participants – 57.5% (n = 23) male and 42.5% (n = 17) female – underwent a clinical swallow evaluation using the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA) augmented with cervical auscultation (CA) and pulse oximetry (PO), an oral hygiene assessment using an adapted version of the Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT), followed by microbiology laboratory analysis of buccal swab samples to detect bacteria not considered part of the normal oral flora. RESULTS: Results indicated that poor oral hygiene status was a common feature amongst all participants who presented with dysphagia. The most prevalent oral hygiene issues were related to abnormalities concerning saliva (60%), oral cleanliness (82.5%), the tongue (80%) and the use of dentures (71.4%). A high prevalence, 62.5% (n = 25), of opportunistic bacteria was found. The most commonly occurring bacteria groups were: (1) Candida albicans (47.5%) and (2) respiratory pathogens (37.5%) such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: Persons with dysphagia have poor oral hygiene which creates favourable environments for bacteria to flourish and increases the prevalence of pathogenic oral bacteria associated with the development of aspiration pneumonia.

PrismNet results for 168 RBPs support its utility for both understanding CLIP-seq results and largely extending such interaction data to accurately analyze additional cell types. Further, PrismNet employs an “attention” strategy to computationally identify exact RBP-binding nucleotides, and we discovered enrichment among dynamic RBP-binding sites for structure-changing variants (riboSNitches), which can link genetic diseases with dysregulated RBP bindings.

The consulted databases were PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, and ProQuest. Eligibility criteria allowed the inclusion of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental trials without applying language, country, publication type or time restrictions. The quality of the eligible studies was appraised by the RoB2 tool of Cochrane for RCTs and JBI critical appraisal tools for quasi-experimental trials. Data items were collected based on PICO acronym by two investigators and reviewed for accuracy by a third one. The evidence was narratively synthesized and validated by proceeding with a random model meta-analysis using Cochrane RevMan software(Version 5.4). The quality of the pooled evidence from meta-analysis was assessed using the tool of GRADE. Out of 29,975 retrieved records, 14 studies (six RCTs and eight quasi-experimental trials) were included. The psychoeducational program significantly reduced acculturative stress and enhanced adjustment. In contrast, cultural orientation and peer-pairing programs significantly enhanced adjustment, but could not reduce acculturative stress. In meta-analysis, acculturative stress was significantly reduced in the psychoeducational intervention versus controls [overall pooled size effect = −3.89 (95% CI: −5.42, −2.53) at p < 0.001]. Similarly, adjustment was significantly enhanced in the psychoeducation and socio-cultural interventions versus control [overall pooled size effect = 3.10 (95% CI: 2.35, 3.85) at p < 0.001]. In conclusion, the psychoeducational program demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing acculturative stress and enhancing adjustment compared to the other interventional programs.

Recently, promising findings have been documented toward the implementation of certain intestinal microbiome in the next era of cancer biology and cancer immunotherapy. Notably, intestinal microbiota can cooperate with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) of its host, especially in enhancing the efficacy of programmed death 1 (PD‐1) protein and its ligand programmed death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) blockade therapy for cancer. Herein, we review the dual function of gut microbiota in triggering GI cancers, its association with host immunity and its beneficial functions in modulation of cancer immunotherapy responses.

Several markers of inflammation can be detected via blood such as variety of blood cells, which can be readily and easily obtained. These markers have been studied as ways to predict and prognosticate tumor response to chemotherapy. With the development of immunotherapy, namely immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and programmed death ligand 1 (PDL-1) PDL-1 inhibitors, several markers have also been studied in assessing tumor response. In this review, we will discuss the various inflammatory markers that have been studied in several tumors treated with ICIs. ABSTRACT: Chronic inflammation is considered a major risk factor for cancer formation. Inflammation within the tumor environment plays a role in its response to therapy, growth, and prognosis. Cancer associated inflammation is known to occur in the tumor microenvironment and in the systemic circulation, and is correlated with disease progression and prognosis in many cancers. Blood cells such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, and circulating proteins such as C-reactive protein, and interleukins, such as IL-6, have been associated with inflammatory responses, which contribute to tumorigenesis. Cancer has found ways to evade the immune response; a pathway that can attenuate the innate immune response is via blocking immune checkpoints. Development of monoclonal antibodies against inhibitory immune checkpoints such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) have given rise to immunotherapy, which has shown remarkable responses in anti-tumor activity resulting in several U.S. Federal and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved checkpoint inhibitors.

P.aeruginosa was the pathogen most frequently responsible for VAP 69/108 (63.88%). Mean frequency of VAP, UTI and CLA-BSI with P.aeruginosa etiology was 69/493 (14.28%), 32/299 (11.1%) and 7/127 (5.77%) respectively. The mean density of P.aeruginosa infection amounted to 2.43/1000 patient-days. The decrease was observed in the total number of DA-HAIs caused by the P.aeruginosa from 15.75% and 3.23/1000 patient-days in 2011 to 5.0% and 1.17/1000 in 2016 (p = 0.0104, p = 0.0348).

Among nosocomial pneumonia subtypes, ventilated HABP (vHABP) is associated with the lowest survival. In the ASPECT-NP randomized, controlled trial, participants with vHABP treated with ceftolozane/tazobactam had lower 28-day all-cause mortality (ACM) than those receiving meropenem. We conducted a series of post hoc analyses to explore the clinical significance of this finding. METHODS: ASPECT-NP was a multinational, phase 3, noninferiority trial comparing ceftolozane/tazobactam with meropenem for treating vHABP and VABP; study design, efficacy, and safety results have been reported previously. The primary endpoint was 28-day ACM. The key secondary endpoint was clinical response at test-of-cure. Participants with vHABP were a prospectively defined subgroup, but subgroup analyses were not powered for noninferiority testing. We compared baseline and treatment factors, efficacy, and safety between ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem in participants with vHABP. We also conducted a retrospective multivariable logistic regression analysis in this subgroup to determine the impact of treatment arm on mortality when adjusted for significant prognostic factors. RESULTS: Overall, 99 participants in the ceftolozane/tazobactam and 108 in the meropenem arm had vHABP. 28-day ACM was 24.2% and 37.0%, respectively, in the intention-to-treat population (95% confidence interval [CI] for difference: 0.2, 24.8) and 18.2% and 36.6%, respectively, in the microbiologic intention-to-treat population (95% CI 2.5, 32.5). Clinical cure rates in the intention-to-treat population were 50.5% and 44.4%, respectively (95% CI − 7.4, 19.3). Baseline clinical, baseline microbiologic, and treatment factors were comparable between treatment arms. Multivariable regression identified concomitant vasopressor use and baseline bacteremia as significantly impacting ACM in ASPECT-NP; adjusting for these two factors, the odds of dying by day 28 were 2.3-fold greater when participants received meropenem instead of ceftolozane/tazobactam. CONCLUSIONS: There were no underlying differences between treatment arms expected to have biased the observed survival advantage with ceftolozane/tazobactam in the vHABP subgroup.

Disparities in SARI death in children aged <5 years exist in urban and rural areas. OBJECTIVE: To compare the factors associated with in-hospital death among children aged <5 years hospitalized with SARI in an urban vs. a rural setting in South Africa from 2009–2013. METHODS: Data were collected from hospitalized children with SARI in one urban and two rural sentinel surveillance hospitals. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for ten respiratory viruses and blood for pneumococcal DNA using polymerase chain reaction. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify patient and clinical characteristics associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS: From 2009 through 2013, 5,297 children aged <5 years with SARI-associated hospital admission were enrolled; 3,811 (72%) in the urban and 1,486 (28%) in the rural hospitals. In-hospital case-fatality proportion (CFP) was higher in the rural hospitals (6.9%) than the urban hospital (1.3%, p<0.001), and among HIV-infected than the HIV-uninfected children (9.6% vs. 1.6%, p<0.001). In the urban hospital, HIV infection (odds ratio (OR):11.4, 95% confidence interval (CI):5.4–24.1) and presence of any other underlying illness (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.0–9.2) were the only factors independently associated with death. In the rural hospitals, HIV infection (OR: 4.1, 95% CI: 2.3–7.1) and age <1 year (OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 1.9–7.2) were independently associated with death, whereas duration of hospitalization ≥5 days (OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3–0.8) and any respiratory virus detection (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3–0.8) were negatively associated with death. CONCLUSION: We found that the case-fatality proportion was substantially higher among children admitted to rural hospitals and HIV infected children with SARI in South Africa.

We aimed to study the access to SPC that COPD and lung cancer (LC) patients receive and how that access affects the need for acute hospital care. METHODS: A descriptive regional registry study using data acquired through VAL, the Stockholm Regional Council’s central data warehouse, which covers nearly all healthcare use in the county of Stockholm. All the patients who died of COPD or LC from 2015 to 2019 were included. T-tests, chi-2 tests, and univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed on the accumulated data. RESULTS: In total, 6479 patients, (2917 with COPD and 3562 with LC) were studied. The patients with LC had more access to SPC during the last three months of life than did those with COPD (77% vs. 18%, respectively; p < .0001), whereas patients with COPD were more likely to be residents of nursing homes than those with LC (32% vs. 9%, respectively; p < .0001). Higher socioeconomic status (SES) (p < .01) and patient age < 80 years (p < .001) were associated with increased access to SPC for LC patients. Access to SPC correlated with fewer emergency room visits (p < .0001 for both COPD and LC patients) and fewer admissions to acute hospitals during the last month of life (p < .0001 for both groups). More COPD patients died in acute hospitals than lung cancer patients, (39% vs. 20%; χ(2) = 287, p < .0001), with significantly lower figures for those who had access to SPC (p < .0001).

In the present study, we investigated whether communication between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum contributes to cardiomyocyte death after myocardial infarction. Our data demonstrated that hypoxia treatment (mimicking myocardial infarction) promoted cardiomyocyte death by inducing the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. The activation of JNK under hypoxic conditions was dependent on overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in cardiomyocytes, and mitochondrial division was identified as the upstream inducer of mtROS overproduction. Silencing mitochondrial division activators, such as B cell receptor associated protein 31 (BAP31) and mitochondrial fission 1 (Fis1), repressed mitochondrial division, thereby inhibiting mtROS overproduction and preventing JNK-induced cardiomyocyte death under hypoxic conditions. These data revealed that a novel death-inducing mechanism involving the BAP31/Fis1/mtROS/JNK axis promotes hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte damage. Considering that BAP31 is localized within the endoplasmic reticulum and Fis1 is localized in mitochondria, abnormal mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum communication may be a useful therapeutic target after myocardial infarction.",2021-08-03,"Cheng, Degang; Zheng, Jia; Hu, Fang; Lv, Wei; Lu, Chengzhi",Front Physiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/958e59ef2205c3c1f53aeb3061b4db15b33661a6.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8369510.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8369510/,

APPROACH AND RESULTS: 3KO mice displayed significantly reduced platelet superoxide radical generation, which was associated with impaired platelet aggregation, adhesion, and thrombus formation in response to the key agonists collagen and thrombin. A comparison with single-gene knockouts suggested that the phenotype of 3KO platelets is the combination of the effects of the genetic deletion of NOX1 and NOX2, while NOX4 does not show any significant function in platelet regulation. 3KO platelets displayed significantly higher levels of cGMP—a negative platelet regulator that activates PKG (protein kinase G). The inhibition of PKG substantially but only partially rescued the defective phenotype of 3KO platelets, which are responsive to both collagen and thrombin in the presence of the PKG inhibitors KT5823 or Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs, but not in the presence of the NOS (NO synthase) inhibitor L-NG-monomethyl arginine. In vivo, triple NOX deficiency protected against ferric chloride–driven carotid artery thrombosis and experimental pulmonary embolism, while hemostasis tested in a tail-tip transection assay was not affected. Procoagulatory activity of platelets (ie, phosphatidylserine surface exposure) and the coagulation cascade in platelet-free plasma were normal.

The present study found that GACAT1 was overexpressed in NSCLC tissues and was associated with poor outcomes in patients with NSCLC. Functional experiments revealed that GACAT1 downregulation inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of 2 NSCLC cell lines. GACAT1 was found to target microRNA(miR)-422a mechanically and negatively regulated miR-422a expression. Reduced expression of miR-422a in NSCLC tissues was inversely correlated with that of GACAT1. Furthermore, YY1 transcription factor (YY1) was identified as a downstream miR-422a target. Reduced expression of GACAT1 inactivated YY1 by sponging miR-422a in NSCLC cells.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates readers’ responses to media reports on violence against doctors to identify attitudes toward perpetrators and physicians and examine if such trends are influenced by national policies. METHODS: We searched 17 Chinese violence against doctors reports in international media sources from 2011 to 2020. We then tracked back the original reports and web crawled the 19,220 comments in China. To ascertain the possible turning point of public opinion, we searched violence against doctors–related policies from Tsinghua University ipolicy database from 2011 to 2020, and found 19 policies enacted by the Chinese central government aimed at alleviating the intense patient–physician relationship. We then conducted a series of interrupted time series analyses to examine the influence of these policies on public sentiment toward violence against doctors over time. RESULTS: The interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) showed that the change in public sentiment toward violence against doctors reports was temporally associated with government interventions. The declarations of 10 of the public policies were followed by increases in the proportion of online public opinion in support of doctors (average slope changes of 0.010, P<.05). A decline in the proportion of online public opinion that blamed doctors (average level change of –0.784, P<.05) followed the declaration of 3 policies.

Headache and visual disturbances are frequent complaints of IIH patients, but little is known about other symptoms. In this study, we evaluated the patients’ perspective on the burden of IIH. METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we developed an online survey for patients with IIH containing standardized evaluations of headache (HIT-6), sleep (PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scale) and depression (MDI) in relation to BMI, lumbar puncture opening pressure (LP OP) and treatment. RESULTS: Between December 2019 and February 2020, 306 patients completed the survey. 285 (93 %) were female, mean age was 36.6 years (± 10.8), mean BMI 34.2 (± 7.3) and mean LP OP at diagnosis was 37.8 cmH(2)O (± 9.5). 219 (72 %) of the participants were obese (BMI ≥ 30); 251 (82 %) reported severe impacting headaches, 140 (46 %) were suffering from sleep disturbances and 169 (56 %) from depression.

We gathered patients' information about outpatient visits and hospital admissions in the Nephrology Department of a large tertiary hospital in western China from January 1st, 2014, to December 31st, 2016, and we used big data-enabled analysis methods, including univariate analysis and multivariate linear regression models, to explore the factors affecting waiting time. We found that gender (P=0.048), the day of issuing the admission card (Saturday, P=0.028), the applied period for admission (P < 0.001), and the registration interval (P < 0.001) were positive influencing factors of patients' waiting time. Disease type (after kidney transplantation, P < 0.001), number of diagnoses (P=0.037), and the day of issuing the admission card (Sunday, P=0.001) were negative factors. A linear regression model built using these data performed well in the identification of factors affecting the waiting time of patients in the Nephrology Department. These results can be extended to other departments and could be valuable for improving patient satisfaction and hospital service quality by identifying the factors affecting waiting time.",2021-05-27,"Li, Jialing; Zhu, Guiju; Luo, Li; Shen, Wenwu",J Healthc Eng,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/88e1597f28ca9357af70bff6ea8616074d552301.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8178001.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8178001/,

Among many challenges in PoC clinical trial design and analysis, the application of multiplicity comparison procedures (MCP) is frequently discussed when multiple doses or drugs are included in one PoC study. In such discussion, one fundamental question of applying multiplicity adjustment is which error one should consider to control and at what level. Should it be the experiment-wise error or the compound-wise error? In this paper, the multiplicity issues in two cases of PoC studies are used as examples to discuss the concept of different types of error and the level of the error rate control. With a clear understanding of the type of error and error rate control, the debate of applications of the multiplicity adjustment procedures in the PoC studies can be reconciled.",2021-05-24,"Li, Qian H.; Deng, Qiqi; Ting, Naitee",Ther Innov Regul Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/86b23c696169043e07f8bdeebca21e51cf645cd5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8142878.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8142878/,

A potential approach to block resistance is to simultaneously inhibit WT and known escape variants of the target bacterial protein. Here, we applied an integrated computational and experimental approach to discover compounds that inhibit both WT and trimethoprim (TMP) resistant mutants of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). We identified a novel compound (CD15-3) that inhibits WT DHFR and its TMP resistant variants L28R, P21L and A26T with IC(50) 50–75 µM against WT and TMP-resistant strains. Resistance to CD15-3 was dramatically delayed compared to TMP in in vitro evolution. Whole genome sequencing of CD15-3-resistant strains showed no mutations in the target folA locus. Rather, gene duplication of several efflux pumps gave rise to weak (about twofold increase in IC(50)) resistance against CD15-3.

METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for randomized, before-after and cohort studies that implemented a clinical decision support system for hospitalized patients with acute kidney injury between 1990 and 2019. The studies must describe their impact on care processes, patient-related outcomes, or hospital length of stay. The clinical decision support system included both electronic alerts and care bundles. RESULTS: We identified seven studies involving 32,846 participants. Clinical decision support system implementation significantly reduced mortality (OR 0.86; 95 % CI, 0.75–0.99; p = 0.040, I(2) = 65.3 %; n = 5 studies; N = 30,791 participants) and increased the proportion of acute kidney injury recognition (OR 3.12; 95 % CI, 2.37–4.10; p < 0.001, I(2) = 77.1 %; n = 2 studies; N = 25,121 participants), and investigations (OR 3.07; 95 % CI, 2.91–3.24; p < 0.001, I(2) = 0.0 %; n = 2 studies; N = 25,121 participants).

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women that usually involves phenotypically diverse populations of breast cancer cells and an heterogeneous stroma. In recent years, automated microscopy technologies are allowing the study of live cells over extended periods of time, simplifying the task of compiling large image databases. For instance, there have been several studies oriented towards building machine learning systems capable of automatically classifying images of different cell types (i.e. motor neurons, stem cells). In this work we were interested in classifying breast cancer cells as live or dead, based on a set of automatically retrieved morphological characteristics using image processing techniques. Our hypothesis is that live-dead classification can be performed without any staining and using only bright-field images as input. We tackled this problem using the JIMT-1 breast cancer cell line that grows as an adherent monolayer. First, a vast image set composed by JIMT-1 human breast cancer cells that had been exposed to a chemotherapeutic drug treatment (doxorubicin and paclitaxel) or vehicle control was compiled. Next, several classifiers were trained based on well-known convolutional neural networks (CNN) backbones to perform supervised classification using labels obtained from fluorescence microscopy images associated with each bright-field image. Model performances were evaluated and compared on a large number of bright-field images. The best model reached an AUC = 0.941 for classifying breast cancer cells without treatment. Furthermore, it reached AUC = 0.978 when classifying breast cancer cells under drug treatment. Our results highlight the potential of machine learning and computational image analysis to build new diagnosis tools that benefit the biomedical field by reducing cost, time, and stimulating work reproducibility. More importantly, we analyzed the way our classifiers clusterize bright-field images in the learned high-dimensional embedding and linked these groups to salient visual characteristics in live-dead cell biology observed by trained experts.",2021-05-13,"Pattarone, Gisela; Acion, Laura; Simian, Marina; Iarussi, Emmanuel",Sci Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/10aa92ebe71b4688661300c6d01b5aa7b021ed6f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8119670.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8119670/,

Anaphylactic reactions that present solely with hypotension without pulmonary or mucocutaneous signs have yet to be described during renal transplant surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a case of a 33-year-old female with end-stage renal disease who underwent cadaveric renal transplant. She developed anaphylaxis following the administration of cefazolin. Despite this reaction, the surgery was ultimately completed after patient stabilization, and the patient had excellent graft function postoperatively. The patient had an elevated tryptase at the time of the reaction and postoperative allergy testing revealed a positive intradermal test to cefazolin. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for all procedures, studies, and publication of this case report. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case of a successful zero-mismatch cadaveric renal transplant following an anaphylactic reaction to cefazolin. Although anaphylaxis during transplant surgery typically warrants cancellation due to the hemodynamic effects that may lead to graft dysfunction, here we describe a case where surgery was continued following patient stabilization.

Achromopeptidase (ACP) is a well-known enzyme that hydrolyzes a number of proteins, notably proteins on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria. It is therefore used for sample preparation in nucleic acid tests. However, ACP inhibits DNA amplification which makes its integration difficult. Heat is commonly used to inactivate ACP, but it can be challenging to integrate heating into point-of-care devices. Here, we use recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) together with ACP, and show that when ACP is immobilized on nitrocellulose paper, it retains its enzymatic function and can easily and rapidly be activated using agitation. The nitrocellulose-bound ACP does, however, not leak into the solution, preventing the need for deactivation through heat or by other means.

We examined the clinical data from patients with CPE infections and their outcomes, concentrating on Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. We analysed the clinical information, performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and conducted molecular epidemiological and genomic analyses on the isolates to identify patterns in the data. METHODS: The clinical characteristics of 33 hospitalised patients with confirmed CPE, including patient-related factors associated with the development of CPE infections, were examined. Patients were divided according to whether they were “colonised” or “infected” with CPE and by the timing and frequency of their rectal swab collections, from which 45 swabs were randomly selected for analysis. CPE isolates were purified, and antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. Whole genome sequences of these isolates were determined and analysed to compute bacterial multilocus sequence types and plasmid replicon types, infer phylogenetic relationships, and identify antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. RESULTS: Altogether, 88.9% (40/45) of the CPE isolates were K. pneumoniae. The most abundant carbapenemase gene family in the K. pneumoniae isolates (33/39) was bla(OXA-232), with bla(NDM-1) additionally identified in 19 of them. All CPE isolates carrying either bla(OXA-232) or bla(NDM-1) were resistant to meropenem, but only 40 from 45 were susceptible to colistin. Among the CPE-infected patients (n = 18) and CPE-colonised patients who developed CPE infections during the study (n = 3), all but one received standard colistin-based combination therapy. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the polyclonal spread of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (CPKP) within the patient population, with the following two major subclades identified: ST16 (n = 15) and ST231 (n = 14). CPKP-ST231 had the highest virulence score of 4 and was associated with primary bacteraemia. The siderophores yersiniabactin and aerobactin, considered to be important virulence factors, were only identified in the CPKP-ST231 genomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed the genomic features of colonising CPE isolates, focusing on antimicrobial resistance and virulence determinants. This type of multi-layered analysis can be further exploited in Thailand and elsewhere to modify the regimes used for empirical antibiotic treatment and improve the management strategies for CPE infections in hospitalised patients.

Here, we introduce a mathematical framework to characterize optimal strategies to store memory to maximize the utility of immune response over an organism’s lifetime. We show that memory production should be actively regulated to balance between affinity and cross-reactivity of immune receptors for an effective protection against evolving pathogens. Moreover, we predict that specificity of memory should depend on the organism’s lifespan, and shorter lived organisms with fewer pathogenic encounters should store more cross-reactive memory.

We provide a reference atlas of human lung endothelial cells (ECs) to facilitate a better understanding of the phenotypic diversity and composition of cells comprising the lung endothelium. METHODS: We reprocessed human control single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from 6 datasets. EC populations were characterized through iterative clustering with subsequent differential expression analysis. Marker genes were validated by fluorescent microscopy and in situ hybridization. scRNAseq of primary lung ECs cultured in vitro was performed. The signaling network between different lung cell types was studied. For cross-species analysis or disease relevance, we applied the same methods to scRNAseq data obtained from mouse lungs or from human lungs with pulmonary hypertension. RESULTS: Six lung scRNAseq datasets were reanalyzed and annotated to identify >15 000 vascular EC cells from 73 individuals. Differential expression analysis of EC revealed signatures corresponding to endothelial lineage, including panendothelial, panvascular, and subpopulation-specific marker gene sets. Beyond the broad cellular categories of lymphatic, capillary, arterial, and venous ECs, we found previously indistinguishable subpopulations; among venous EC, we identified 2 previously indistinguishable populations: pulmonary–venous ECs (COL15A1(neg)) localized to the lung parenchyma and systemic–venous ECs (COL15A1(pos)) localized to the airways and the visceral pleura; among capillary ECs, we confirmed their subclassification into recently discovered aerocytes characterized by EDNRB, SOSTDC1, and TBX2 and general capillary EC. We confirmed that all 6 endothelial cell types, including the systemic–venous ECs and aerocytes, are present in mice and identified endothelial marker genes conserved in humans and mice. Ligand-receptor connectome analysis revealed important homeostatic crosstalk of EC with other lung resident cell types. scRNAseq of commercially available primary lung ECs demonstrated a loss of their native lung phenotype in culture. scRNAseq revealed that endothelial diversity is maintained in pulmonary hypertension.

This study used PALISADE data to estimate the reduction in the risk of systemic allergic reaction (SAR) after accidental exposure following 1 year of PTAH treatment. METHODS: Participants (aged 4–17 years) enrolled in PALISADE were included. Parametric interval-censoring survival analysis with the maximum likelihood estimation was used to construct a real-world distribution of peanut protein exposure using lifetime SAR history and highest tolerated dose (HTD) from a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge conducted at baseline. The SAR risk reduction was extrapolated using the exposure distribution and the HTD were collected at baseline and trial exit for PTAH- and placebo-treated participants. RESULTS: Assuming a maximum peanut protein intake of 1500 mg, participants were estimated to have < 1% probability of ingesting > 0.01 mg during daily life. The mean annual SAR risk at trial entry was 9.25–9.98%. At trial exit, the relative SAR risk reduction following accidental exposure was 94.9% for PTAH versus 6.4% for placebo. For PTAH-treated participants with exit HTD of 600 or 1000 mg without dose-limiting symptoms, the SAR risk reduction increased to 97.2%. The result was consistent in the sensitivity analysis across different parametric distributions. CONCLUSION: Oral immunotherapy with PTAH is expected to result in a substantially greater reduction in risk of SAR following accidental exposure compared to placebo among children with peanut allergy.

4td3cpvr,,PMC,The Smartphone App haMSter for Tracking Patient-Reported Outcomes in People With Multiple Sclerosis: Protocol for a Pilot Study,10.2196/25011,PMC8140378,33960949,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: Treatment and monitoring decisions in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) are based commonly on clinician-reported outcomes. These reflect physical and radiological disease activity and are the most relevant endpoints in clinical trials. Over the past few years, the number of studies evaluating so-called patient-reported outcomes (PROs) has been increasing. PROs are reports from patients concerning their own health perception. They are typically obtained by means of questionnaires and aim to quantify symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and sexual dysfunction. The emergence of PROs has made a tremendous contribution to understanding the individual impact of disease in people with MS and their health-related quality of life. However, the assessment of PROs consumes resources, including time and personnel. Thus, useful ways to conveniently introduce PROs into clinical practice are needed. OBJECTIVE: We aim to provide a rationale and pilot study protocol for a mobile health (mHealth) solution named “haMSter” that allows for remote monitoring of PROs in people with MS. METHODS: The core function of haMSter is to provide three scientifically validated PRO questionnaires relevant to MS for patients to fill out at home once a month. Thereby, longitudinal and remote documentation of PROs is enabled. A scoring algorithm graphically plots PRO scores over time and makes them available at the next visit. RESULTS: The pilot study is currently ongoing and will evaluate adherence to this mHealth solution in 50 patients over a period of 6 months. Results from the haMSter pilot study are expected in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: haMSter is a novel mHealth-based solution for modern PRO research, which may constitute the first step in achieving the ability to integrate PROs in clinical practice. This allows for a more problem-oriented approach in monitoring visits, which addresses patient needs and ultimately saves time.

METHODS: We included patients with human rabies who attended a reference hospital in the state of Ceará during 1976-2019. RESULTS: Data were available for 63 out of 171 (36.8%) patients. Of these patients, 48 (76.2%) were attacked by dogs. In recent years, wild animals have been the most common aggressor species (marmosets and bats). Only 39 (70%) patients were initially correctly suspected with rabies. Bites were the most frequent exposure (56; 96%), most commonly on the hands (21; 42%) and the head (9; 18.4%). Only 14 (22%) patients had sought medical assistance before the onset of symptoms, and only one completed post-exposure prophylaxis. The most prevalent signs and symptoms included aggressiveness/irritability (50; 79.4%), fever (42; 66.7%), sore throat/dysphagia (40; 63.5%), and myalgia (28; 44.4%). Hydrophobia was present in 17 patients (22.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of human rabies in Ceará occurred due to the failure to seek medical assistance and/or the failure of the health system in initiating early post-exposure prophylaxis.

Variations in dengue virus (DENV) genes are important features of epidemic outbreaks. However, the associations of DENV genes with epidemic potential have not been extensively examined. Here, we assessed new genotype invasion of DENV-1 isolated from Guangzhou in China to evaluate associations with epidemic outbreaks. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used DENV-1 strains isolated from sera of dengue cases from 2002 to 2016 in Guangzhou for complete genome sequencing. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed to elucidate the genotype characteristics and determine if new genotype invasion was correlated with major outbreaks. In our study, a new genotype invasion event was observed during each significant outbreak period in 2002–2003, 2006–2007, and 2013–2014. Genotype II was the main epidemic genotype in 2003 and before. Invasion of genotype I in 2006 caused an unusual outbreak with 765 cases (relative risk [RR] = 16.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.41–21.25). At the middle and late stages of the 2013 outbreak, genotype III was introduced to Guangzhou as a new genotype invasion responsible for 37,340 cases with RR 541.73 (95% CI 417.78–702.45), after which genotypes I and III began co-circulating. Base mutations occurred after new genotype invasion, and the gene sequence of NS3 protein had the lowest average similarity ratio (99.82%), followed by the gene sequence of E protein (99.86%), as compared to the 2013 strain. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Genotype replacement and co-circulation of multiple DENV-1 genotypes were observed. New genotype invasion was highly correlated with local unusual outbreaks. In addition to DENV-1 genotype I in the unprecedented outbreak in 2014, new genotype invasion by DENV-1 genotype III occurred in Guangzhou.

However, prompt and accurate diagnosis of PAH remains an unmet challenge due to lack of awareness and lack of meticulous data to profile the etiology and pathophysiology of this rare progressive disease, especially in low- and middle-income country. In Indonesia, the true prevalence and incidence of different subtypes of PAH in general population is still unknown. The Congenital HeARt Disease in adult and Pulmonary Hypertension (COHARD-PH) registry was the first single-center prospective registry in Indonesia, which indicated that almost 80% of adult patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) had experienced PAH and even Eisenmenger syndrome due to delayed diagnosis. Screening for early detection of asymptomatic CHD in children is yet to be systematically established in Indonesia, leading to undiagnosed and uncorrected CHD in adulthood. There are no specific national guidelines focusing on diagnostic workup and treatment of PAH in Indonesia. Furthermore, the lack of adequate diagnostic facilities, limited treatment availability, and limited drug coverage under the National Health Insurance Scheme are key issues that remain unaddressed. This review focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of PAH associated with CHD in Indonesia as per international guidelines. We have proposed recommendations to effectively control and prevent PAH associated with CHD in Indonesia. The paper should be of interest to readers in the area of medical management and policy makers especially in low- and middle-income countries. KEY HIGHLIGHTS: 1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare progressive subtype of pulmonary hypertension with poor overall prognosis and outcomes. 2. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of PAH remains an unmet challenge in low- and middle-income countries due to poor knowledge about the etiology and pathophysiology of this syndrome. Also, the symptoms and signs of early-stage PAH are usually nonspecific or undetectable in newborn and infants, thus presenting a challenge for physicians to establish early diagnoses of PAH. 3. The challenging factors in low- and middle-income countries, especially Indonesia archipelago are limitations of healthcare infrastructure, limited expertise, lack of awareness, lack of timely PAH screening strategies, poor antenatal care and unpredictable availability of PAH medications. 4. There are no specific national guidelines focusing on diagnostic workup and treatment of PAH in Indonesia. Under-utilization of treatment guidelines and lack of adequate diagnostic treatment facilities have resulted in sub-optimal management of PAH patients in Indonesia. 5. Adherence to international guidelines is an important aspect of PAH management in Indonesia. Updated disease and functional classifications of PAH as per international guidelines along with new research findings on prognostic factors can help in making better management decisions for PAH patients at different stages of the disease.",2021-04-20,"Dinarti, Lucia Kris; Anggrahini, Dyah Wulan; Lilyasari, Oktavia; Siswanto, Bambang Budi; Hartopo, Anggoro Budi",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/adac66dae4513f50da5429c7a2109635f119470d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8064285.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8064285/,

In this review, we present information on the classification, characteristics, and synthetic methods of hollow gold nanostructures; discuss the recent advances in hollow gold nanostructures in biomedical applications, including biosensing, bioimaging, photothermal therapy, and drug delivery; and report on the existing challenges and prospects for hollow gold nanostructures.",2021-06-08,"Park, Jeong-Min; Choi, Hye Eun; Kudaibergen, Dauletkerey; Kim, Jae-Hyuk; Kim, Ki Su",Front Chem,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b838b9a89cae637214a2a58a21a42d5a6dfdd973.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8217768.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217768/,

The education sector has high potential to improve immediate nutrition outcomes by providing food in schools and to have more long‐term impact through education. We developed a conceptual framework to show how the education sector can be leveraged for nutrition. We reviewed the literature to identify existing frameworks outlining how nutrition programs can be delivered by and through the education sector and used these to build a comprehensive framework. We first organized nutrition programs in the education sector into (1) school food, meals, and food environment; (2) nutrition and health education; (3) physical activity and education; (4) school health services; and (5) water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector. We then discuss how each one can be successfully implemented. We found high potential in improving nutrition standards and quality of school foods, meals and food environment, especially through collaboration with the agriculture sector. There is a need for well‐integrated, culturally appropriate nutrition and health education into the existing school curriculum. This must be supported by a skilled workforce—including nutrition and public health professionals and school staff. Parental and community engagement is cornerstone for program sustainability and success. Current monitoring and evaluation of nutrition programming in schools is weak, and effectiveness, including cost‐effectiveness, of interventions is not yet adequately quantified. Finally, we note that opportunities for leveraging the education sector in the fight against rising overweight and obesity rates are under‐researched and likely underutilized in LMICs.",2021-02-16,"Xu, Yvonne Yiru; Sawadogo‐Lewis, Talata; King, Shannon E.; Mitchell, Arlene; Roberton, Timothy",Matern Child Nutr,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b685528fadba98de4541d03d234926cf0e15617b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8189246.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8189246/,

These technologies facilitate the assessment of the genetic diversity in intra-host virus populations, which affects transmission, virulence and pathogenesis of viral infections. However, there are two major challenges in analysing viral diversity. First, amplification and sequencing errors confound the identification of true biological variants, and second, the large data volumes represent computational limitations. RESULTS: To support viral high-throughput sequencing studies, we developed V-pipe, a bioinformatics pipeline combining various state-of-the-art statistical models and computational tools for automated end-to-end analyses of raw sequencing reads. V-pipe supports quality control, read mapping and alignment, low-frequency mutation calling, and inference of viral haplotypes. For generating high-quality read alignments, we developed a novel method, called ngshmmalign, based on profile hidden Markov models and tailored to small and highly diverse viral genomes. V-pipe also includes benchmarking functionality providing a standardized environment for comparative evaluations of different pipeline configurations. We demonstrate this capability by assessing the impact of three different read aligners (Bowtie 2, BWA MEM, ngshmmalign) and two different variant callers (LoFreq, ShoRAH) on the performance of calling single-nucleotide variants in intra-host virus populations. V-pipe supports various pipeline configurations and is implemented in a modular fashion to facilitate adaptations to the continuously changing technology landscape.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe HS. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Pooled estimates, namely standardized mean difference (SMD) and relative risk (RR), were calculated using random-effect model with trial sequential analysis. Small study effects were examined using the Doi plot. Certainty of evidence (CoE) was assessed using “The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation” approach, and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) was calculated. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials, involving 1014 patients, were included. We performed subgroup analysis of adalimumab administered subcutaneously both weekly and every other week. Adalimumab administered weekly was associated with better clinical response achievement (RR 1.76, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.35–2.29; trial sequential analysis TSA-adjusted CI 1.01–3.08; CoE: low; NNT = 5) and a significant improvement in modified Sartorius score (SMD = −0.45, 95% CI = −0.76 to −0.13; CoE: very low; NNT = 10) and dermatology life quality index (DLQI) (SMD −0.47, 95% CI −0.61 to −0.32; CoE: low; NNT = 10). Nevertheless, adalimumab administered every other week showed an improvement only in modified Sartorius score. The pooled RRs of adverse events in both groups revealed no statistical significance when compared with the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab administered weekly resulted in not only better clinical responses than placebo but also significantly improved disease severity and quality of life of patients with moderate-to-severe HS.

DESIGN: An agent-based model was utilized to evaluate prevention strategies in an efficient, ethical manner. By defining agents, their characteristics and relationships, we assessed population-level effects of PrEP on HIV incidence. METHODS: We tested hypothetical PrEP prescription strategies within a simulation representing the African–American population of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Four strategies were evaluated: PrEP for women meeting CDC indicators regarding partner characteristics, PrEP for women with a recently incarcerated male partner, PrEP for women with a recently released male partner and couples-based PrEP at time of release. Interventions occurred alongside scale-up of HAART. We evaluated reductions in HIV transmissions, the number of persons on PrEP needed to avert one HIV transmission (NNT) and the resulting proportions of people on PrEP. RESULTS: Scenarios prescribing PrEP based on criminal justice system involvement reduced HIV transmissions. The NNT ranged from 147 (couples-based scenario) to 300 (recently released scenario). The percentage of the female population covered by PrEP at any one time ranged from 0.14% (couples-based) to 10.8% (CDC-based). CDC-guideline scenarios were consistently less efficient compared to the justice-involved interventions. CONCLUSION: Expanding PrEP for African–American women and their male partners affected by incarceration should be considered in national HIV prevention goals and correctional facilities leveraged as intervention sites.

We aimed to compare the parenteral nutrition (PN) regimen with the current guidelines, evaluate weight gain and explore the correlation of parenteral macronutrient and energy intakes with weight gain outcome in preterm infants with birth weight less than 1500 g. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted. Parenteral macronutrients and energy intakes were described. Weight gain during PN was assessed. Nutritional factors associated with weight gain outcome after PN were identified using a cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 163 infants were included in this study, in which 41 were extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants and 122 were very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Average glucose, amino acid, lipid, and energy during the first postnatal week were 7.5 g/kg/d, 2.4 g/kg/d, 0.8 g/kg/d, 48 kcal/kg/d. Median maximum glucose, amino acid, lipid, and energy were 11.1 g/kg/d, 3.5 g/kg/d, 3 g/kg/d, 78 kcal/kg/d. Median days to maximum glucose, amino acid, lipid, and energy were 10, 9, 12, 11 days. The proportion of appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants was 76.9%. The ratio of infants without poor weight gain outcome after PN was 38%. With every 0.1 g/kg/d decrease of maximum amino acid and average lipid during the first postnatal week, the probability of appropriate weight gain outcome decreased by 77.6 and 74.4% respectively. With each additional day to maximum glucose and energy, the probability of appropriate weight gain outcome decreased by 5.6 and 6.1% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most preterm infants with birth weight less than 1500 g remain below the latest recommended nutrition goals. The poor weight gain outcome of these infants after PN is related to insufficient parenteral macronutrient and energy intakes.

Although Bangladesh is in the world’s thalassaemia belt, the information on this disease is scarce. Additionally, the awareness of this life threatening, but potentially preventable disease is surprisingly poor. However, mass awareness is pivotal for the development of an effective preventive strategy. In this context, the understanding of parental perspectives is essential to grasp the magnitude of the problem. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the parental knowledge gaps and perceptions regarding thalassemia, the barriers confronted by the parents for caring for their thalassaemic children and their attitude to prenatal screening and prenatal diagnosis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2018 and December 2018 at a dedicated thalassemia hospital located in Dhaka. A structured questionnaire was used for face-to-face interviews with parents of thalassaemic children. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data. RESULTS: Of 365 respondents, nearly all respondents (97%) had not heard about the term, ‘thalassemia’ before the disease was diagnosed in their children; all (100%) were unscreened for carrier status prior to marriage. Mean knowledge scores were significantly higher in respondents with higher income and education. Most respondents (~ 91%) had a guilty feeling for not undergoing premarital screening. Only around 36% of them had heard about prenatal diagnosis. Approximately 25% participants would consider prenatal diagnosis in a future pregnancy, while 70% of them were unsure and only ~ 5% would decline prenatal diagnosis. Only 9.3% mothers had prenatal diagnosis in a previous pregnancy. Nearly 80% of the parents faced difficulty for obtaining blood donors regularly and a similar proportion (~ 81%) of them did not receive support from any organized blood clubs. More than 40% of the parents reported they felt socially stigmatized. CONCLUSION: This study suggests poor parental knowledge regarding thalassaemia including prenatal diagnosis and the challenges faced while caring for their children.

Our aim was to investigate the magnitude and duration of risk for arterial and venous thrombosis following discharge after respiratory infection. Patients with respiratory infections were identified using the United States Nationwide Readmission Database from 2012 to 2014. Patients admitted with asthma or cellulitis served as comparators. Readmissions for acute myocardial infarction (MI) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) were evaluated at 30 to 180 days.

The disease is of concern because most patients have become severely ill with roughly 30% mortality rate. Because the threat in public health caused by H7N9 virus remains high, advance preparedness is essentially needed. In this study, the recombinant H7N9 hemagglutinin (HA) was expressed in insect cells and purified for generation of two monoclonal antibodies, named F3-2 and 1C6B. F3-2 can only recognize the H7N9 HA without having cross-reactivity with HA proteins of H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, and H7N7. 1C6B has the similar specificity with F3-2, but 1C6B can also bind to H7N7 HA. The binding epitope of F3-2 is mainly located in the region of H7N9 HA(299–307). The binding epitope of 1C6B is located in the region of H7N9 HA(489–506). F3-2 and 1C6B could not effectively inhibit the hemagglutination activity of H7N9 HA. However, F3-2 can prevent H7N9 HA from trypsin cleavage and can bind to H7N9 HA which has undergone pH-induced conformational change. F3-2 also has the ability of binding to H7N9 viral particles and inhibiting H7N9 virus infection to MDCK cells with the IC50 value of 22.18 μg/mL. In addition, F3-2 and 1C6B were utilized for comprising a lateral flow immunochromatographic test strip for specific detection of H7N9 HA. KEY POINTS: • Two mouse monoclonal antibodies, F3-2 and 1C6B, were generated for recognizing the novel binding epitopes in H7N9 HA. • F3-2 can prevent H7N9 HA from trypsin cleavage and inhibit H7N9 virus infection to MDCK cells. • F3-2 and 1C6B were developed as a lateral flow immunochromatographic test for specific detection of H7N9 HA.",2021-03-26,"Chiang, Yi-Wei; Li, Chia-Jung; Su, Heng-Yi; Hsieh, Kai-Ting; Weng, Chia-Wei; Chen, Hui-Wen; Chang, Shih-Chung",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6677e4349ecd5fe317f61e02794e55f3906b215f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7995400.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7995400/,

A total of 588 infants were included (293 pre- vs 295 in the post-implementation cohort), with similar gestational age (27.8 weeks pre- vs 27.6 weeks post-implementation), birth weight (1033 grams vs 1035 grams) and other baseline characteristics. Mortality and rate of prematurity complications were not different between the groups. Length of stay in NICU was not different, but duration of invasive ventilation was shorter in infants who received AOC (6.4 ± 10.1 vs 4.7 ± 8.3, p = 0.029). Conclusion: In this pre-post comparison, the implementation of AOC did not lead to a change in mortality or morbidity during admission.",2021-02-23,"Salverda, H. H.; Oldenburger, N.

It is potentially harmful for the lung and the diaphragm, but its detection is challenging. Magnitude of effort generated by RT is currently unknown. Our objective was to validate supervised methods for automatic detection of RT using only airway pressure (Paw) and flow. A secondary objective was to describe the magnitude of the efforts generated during RT. METHODS: We developed algorithms for detection of RT using Paw and flow waveforms. Experts having Paw, flow and esophageal pressure (Pes) assessed automatic detection accuracy by comparison against visual assessment. Muscular pressure (Pmus) was measured from Pes during RT, triggered breaths and ineffective efforts. RESULTS: Tracings from 20 hypoxemic patients were used (mean age 65 ± 12 years, 65% male, ICU survival 75%). RT was present in 24% of the breaths ranging from 0 (patients paralyzed or in pressure support ventilation) to 93.3%. Automatic detection accuracy was 95.5%: sensitivity 83.1%, specificity 99.4%, positive predictive value 97.6%, negative predictive value 95.0% and kappa index of 0.87. Pmus of RT ranged from 1.3 to 36.8 cmH(2)0, with a median of 8.7 cmH(2)0. RT with breath stacking had the highest levels of Pmus, and RTs with no breath stacking were of similar magnitude than pressure support breaths. CONCLUSION: An automated detection tool using airway pressure and flow can diagnose reverse triggering with excellent accuracy. RT generates a median Pmus of 9 cmH(2)O with important variability between and within patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: BEARDS, NCT03447288.

Present the methodology for comprehensive evaluation of the implementation of the Mental Health Global Action Programme (mhGAP) in Chile and describe the program’s results. METHODS. Cross-sectional evaluative study based on a survey of key program informants deployed in 29 public health services in the country, as well as individual interviews and focus groups with key actors and experts. The evaluation was focused on the relevance and impact of mhGAP on the provision of mental health services and on the implementation of the program. RESULTS. The participants gave a positive evaluation of the progressive implementation of mhGAP in Chile. In particular: 1) They reported having better tools for detecting, diagnosing, and treating common disorders, and efficient referral strategies; (2) They rated all modules as important, the most relevant being self-harm/suicide (x¯ = 4.77) and mental and behavioral disorders in children and adolescents (x¯ = 4.58); (3) They favorably assessed the National Mental Health Day training courses and the subsequent courses repeated at the local level, indicating that these courses contributed to successful implementation of mhGAP; (4) They agreed on the need to incorporate new actors, strengthen certain aspects, and expand information on the program. CONCLUSIONS. The implementation of mhGAP in Chile is an emblematic example of learning supported by the development of community mental health and family health, among other factors.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently emerged as important mediators in cell–cell communication and account for part of the cellular secretome. In recent years, there has been a growing body of research on adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (Ad-EVs). However, there is still a lack of standardized methodological approaches, especially regarding primary adipocytes. In this review, we will provide an outline of crucial aspects when working on adipose-derived material, with a special focus on primary adipocytes.

Clinically, the standard for diagnosing OSA involves nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). However, this requires expert human intervention and considerable time, which limits the availability of OSA diagnosis in public health sectors. Therefore, electrocardiogram (ECG)-based methods for OSA detection have been proposed to automate the polysomnography procedure and reduce its discomfort. So far, most of the proposed approaches rely on feature engineering, which calls for advanced expert knowledge and experience. This paper proposes a novel fused-image-based technique that detects OSA using only a single-lead ECG signal. In the proposed approach, a convolutional neural network extracts features automatically from images created with one-minute ECG segments. The proposed network comprises 37 layers, including four residual blocks, a dense layer, a dropout layer, and a soft-max layer. In this study, three time–frequency representations, namely the scalogram, the spectrogram, and the Wigner–Ville distribution, were used to investigate the effectiveness of the fused-image-based approach. We found that blending scalogram and spectrogram images further improved the system’s discriminative characteristics. Seventy ECG recordings from the PhysioNet Apnea-ECG database were used to train and evaluate the proposed model using 10-fold cross validation. The results of this study demonstrated that the proposed classifier can perform OSA detection with an average accuracy, recall, and specificity of 92.4%, 92.3%, and 92.6%, respectively, for the fused spectral images.",2021-04-26,"Niroshana, S.

The aim of this study was to investigate interobserver variability by 2 independent observers compared to laboratory staff in the visual interpretation of factor Xa (DXI) and thrombin inhibitors (DTI) using the DOAC Dipstick test. We also examined whether test pads reacted to other anticoagulants and abnormal urine colors. The colors of the DOAC Dipstick direct factor Xa inhibitor and thrombin inhibitor pads were interpreted with 100% accuracy (95% confidence interval 0.862 to 1.000) for urine samples from persons treated with apixaban (n = 26), rivaroxaban (n = 24), and dabigatran (n = 29) and without anticoagulant therapy (n = 29). The factor Xa and thrombin inhibitor pads did not interact with heparin, nadroparin, fondaparinux, or coumadin. One µg/mL r-Hirudin and 6 µg/mL argatroban interacted with the DTI pad; however, this is unlikely to cause clinical problems because dabigatran is unlikely to be administered together with r-Hirudin and argatroban in clinical circumstances. Abnormal urine color was reliably detected by the urine color pad, so can prevent false interpretation of the DOAC Dipstick pad colors. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that interobserver variability when interpreting the DOAC Dipstick test strip is low and that factor Xa and thrombin inhibitor pads do not react to other anticoagulants such as heparins and coumadin.

i7335j0j,,PMC,Stakeholder Perspectives on Barriers and Facilitators for the Adoption of Virtual Clinical Trials: Qualitative Study,10.2196/26813,PMC8294122,34255673,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: Conventional clinical trials are essential for generating high-quality evidence by measuring the efficacy of interventions in rigorously controlled clinical environments. However, their execution can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, clinical trials face several logistical challenges regarding the identification, recruitment, and retention of participants; consistent data collection during trials; and adequate patient follow-up. This might lead to inefficient resource utilization. In order to partially address the current problems with conventional clinical trials, there exists the need for innovations. One such innovation is the virtual clinical trial (VCT). VCTs allow for the collection and integration of diverse data from multiple information sources, such as electronic health records, clinical and demographic data, patient-reported outcomes, anthropometric and activity measurements, and data collected by digital biomarkers or (small) samples that participants can collect themselves. Although VCTs have the potential to provide substantial value to clinical research and patients because they can lower clinical trial costs, increase the volume of data collected from patients’ daily environment, and reduce the burden of patient participation, so far VCT adoption is not commonplace. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to better understand the barriers and facilitators to VCT adoption by determining the factors that influence individuals’ considerations regarding VCTs from the perspective of various stakeholders. METHODS: Based on online semistructured interviews, a qualitative study was conducted with pharmaceutical companies, food and health organizations, and an applied research organization in Europe. Data were thematically analyzed using Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory. RESULTS: A total of 16 individuals with interest and experience in VCTs were interviewed, including persons from pharmaceutical companies (n=6), food and health organizations (n=4), and a research organization (n=6). Key barriers included a potentially low degree of acceptance by regulatory authorities, technical issues (standardization, validation, and data storage), compliance and adherence, and lack of knowledge or comprehension regarding the opportunities VCTs have to offer. Involvement of regulators in development processes, stakeholder exposure to the results of pilot studies, and clear and simple instructions and assistance for patients were considered key facilitators. CONCLUSIONS: Collaboration among all stakeholders in VCT development is crucial to increase knowledge and awareness. Organizations should invest in accurate data collection technologies, and compliance of patients in VCTs needs to be ensured. Multicriteria decision analysis can help determine if a VCT is a preferred option by stakeholders. The findings of this study can be a good starting point to accelerate the development and widespread implementation of VCTs.",2021-07-06,"Coert, Romée Melanie Helena; Timmis, James Kenneth; Boorsma, André; Pasman, Wilrike J",J Med Internet Res,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8294122.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294122/,

The prognostic significance of this finding for mortality is unclear. METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients with colorectal perforation who underwent emergency surgery were retrospectively reviewed in the study. Dirty mass identified on multi-detector row CT (MDCT) was 3D-reconstructed and its volume was calculated using Ziostation software. Dirty mass volume and other clinical characteristics were compared between survivor (n = 45) and mortality groups (n = 13) to identify predictive factors for mortality. Mann–Whitney U test and Χ(2) test were used in univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis was used in multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Dirty mass was identified in 36/58 patients (62.1%) and located next to perforated colorectum in all cases. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis identified the highest peak at 96.3 cm(3), with sensitivity of 0.643 and specificity of 0.864. Univariate analysis revealed dirty mass volume, acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score as prognostic markers for mortality (p<0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed dirty mass volume and APACHE II score as independent prognostic indicators for mortality. Mortality was stratified by dividing patients into four groups according to dirty mass volume and APACHE II score.

The osseodensification is a drilling technique that has been proposed to improve the local bone quality and implant stability in poor density alveolar ridges. This technique determines an expansion of the implant site by increasing the density of the adjacent bone. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of the osseodensification technique for implant site preparation through a literature review and meta-analysis. The database electronic research was performed on PubMed (Medline) database for the screening of the scientific papers. A total of 16 articles have been identified suitable for the review and qualitative analysis—11 clinical studies (eight on animals, three on human subjects), four literature reviews, and one case report. The meta-analysis was performed to compare the bone-to-implant contact % (BIC), bone area fraction occupied % (BAFO), and insertion torque of clockwise and counter-clockwise osseodensification procedure in animal studies. The included articles reported a significant increase in the insertion torque of the implants positioned through the osseodensification protocol compared to the conventional drilling technique. Advantages of this new technique are important above all when the patient has a strong missing and/or low quantity of bone tissue. The data collected until the drafting of this paper detect an improvement when the osseodensification has been adopted if compared to the conventional technique.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the acute effects of 45 min of official competition (first half in matches) on physical performance variables in U-16 youth soccer players. (2) Methods: 20 male soccer players (age: 14.4 ± 0.5 years; height: 1.70 ± 0.05 cm; body mass: 65.1 ± 11.6 kg) were recruited to participate in this study. Data was collected from five official matches. Participants performed the assessments in two stages of each match: after the pre-match warm-up and after the first half. Tests included rate of perceived exertion (RPE), 30-m sprint and countermovement (CMJ). (3) Results: Statistically significant differences were found (p < 0.001) when the measurements prior to the game were compared with those recorded after half time across all variables. Effect sizes (ES) were very large for RPE (ES = 1.82), moderate for 30-m sprint times (ES = 0.64) and small for CMJ (ES = −0.25). (4) Conclusions: After 45 min of official competition, our results suggest that U-16 soccer players demonstrated a reduction in sprint and jump performance, in addition to a higher RPE.

The organic food industry has benefitted from advances in food technology and innovation. However, there remains skepticism regarding organic foods on the part of consumers, specifically on consumers’ acceptance of food innovation technologies used in the production of organic foods. This study measured factors that influence consumers’ food innovation adoption and subsequently their intention to purchase organic foods. We compared the organic foods purchase behavior of Malaysian and Hungarian consumers to examine differences between Asian and European consumers. The findings show food innovation adoption as the most crucial predictor for the intention to purchase organic foods in Hungary, while social lifestyle factor was the most influential in Malaysia. Other factors such as environmental concerns and health consciousness were also examined in relation to food innovation adoption and organic food consumerism.

Active TB disease can spread by airborne transmission to healthcare workers and to their community. The HHMI SEA-PHAGES program has contributed to discovering bacteriophages that are able to infect M. smegmatis MC(2) 155, a close relative of M. tuberculosis. This collection of diverse Mycobacteriophages is an excellent resource for trialling bacteriophage-sourced enzymes in novel applications. Herein we measured the ability Mycobacteriophage endolysins to lyse their host strain when functionally fused to biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) nanobeads. PHA nanobeads facilitate both the expression and the application of enzymes to surfaces and have been demonstrated to stabilize a wide array of proteins for practical applications whilst eliminating the challenges of traditional protein purification. We selected two Lysin A and six Lysin B homologs to be functionally fused to the polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase C (PhaC). Expression of these constructs resulted in functional lysins displayed on the surface of PHA nanobeads. The lysins thus directionally displayed on nanobeads lysed up to 79% of the M. smegmatis MC(2) 155 population using 80 mg/mL of nanobeads in pure culture. In order to determine whether the nanobeads would be effective as a protective layer in PPE we adapted a fabric-based test and observed a maximum of 1 log loss of the cell population after 5 h of exposure on a textile (91% cell lysis). Lysin B enzymes performed better than the Lysin A enzymes as a protective barrier on textiles surface assays. These results suggest that bacterial endolysins are efficient in their action when displayed on PHA nanobeads and can cause significant population mortality in as little as 45 min. Our results provide the proof-of-principle that Mycobacteriophage endolysins can be used on functionalized nanobeads where they can protect surfaces such as personal protective equipment (PPE) that routinely come into contact with aerosolised bacteria.",2021-04-26,"Davies, Courtney G.; Reilly, Kerri; Altermann, Eric; Hendrickson, Heather L.",Front Microbiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b26072e0e6dbdb14cce63950ee005a8b1076498e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8107382.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8107382/,

Their hands-free interface and growing capabilities have a wide range of applications in health care, covering off-clinic education, health monitoring, and communication. However, conflicting factors, such as patient safety and privacy concerns, make it difficult to foresee the further development of VIPAs in health care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a plausible scenario for the further development of VIPAs in health care to support decision making regarding the procurement of VIPAs in health care organizations. METHODS: We conducted a two-stage Delphi study with an internationally recruited panel consisting of voice assistant experts, medical professionals, and representatives of academia, governmental health authorities, and nonprofit health associations having expertise with voice technology. Twenty projections were formulated and evaluated by the panelists. Descriptive statistics were used to derive the desired scenario. RESULTS: The panelists expect VIPAs to be able to provide solid medical advice based on patients’ personal health information and to have human-like conversations. However, in the short term, voice assistants might neither provide frustration-free user experience nor outperform or replace humans in health care. With a high level of consensus, the experts agreed with the potential of VIPAs to support elderly people and be widely used as anamnesis, informational, self-therapy, and communication tools by patients and health care professionals. Although users’ and governments’ privacy concerns are not expected to decrease in the near future, the panelists believe that strict regulations capable of preventing VIPAs from providing medical help services will not be imposed. CONCLUSIONS: According to the surveyed experts, VIPAs will show notable technological development and gain more user trust in the near future, resulting in widespread application in health care.

Health apps have benefits for individuals (eg, the ability to monitor one’s health) as well as for researchers (eg, the ability to collect data in population-based, clinical, and observational studies). Although the number of health apps on the global app market is huge and the associated potential seems to be great, app-based questionnaires for collecting patient-related data have not played an important role in epidemiological studies so far. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an overview of studies that have collected patient data using an app-based approach, with a particular focus on longitudinal studies. This literature review describes the current extent to which smartphones have been used for collecting (patient) data for research purposes, and the potential benefits and challenges associated with this approach. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of studies that used data collection via apps. PubMed was used to identify studies describing the use of smartphone app questionnaires for collecting data over time. Overall, 17 articles were included in the summary. RESULTS: Based on the results of this scoping review, there are only a few studies that integrate smartphone apps into data-collection approaches. Studies dealing with the collection of health-related data via smartphone apps have mainly been developed with regard to psychosomatic, neurodegenerative, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as malign neoplasm. Among the identified studies, the duration of data collection ranged from 4 weeks to 12 months, and the participants’ mean ages ranged from 7 to 69 years. Potential can be seen for real-time information transfer, fast data synchronization (which saves time and increases effectivity), and the possibility of tracking responses longitudinally. Furthermore, smartphone-based data-collection techniques might prevent biases, such as reminder bias or mistakes occurring during manual data transfers. In chronic diseases, real-time communication with physicians and early detection of symptoms enables rapid modifications in disease management. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that using mobile technologies can help to overcome challenges linked with data collection in epidemiological research. However, further feasibility studies need to be conducted in the near future to test the applicability and acceptance of these mobile apps for epidemiological research in various subpopulations.",2021-01-22,"Fischer, Florian; Kleen, Sina",J Med Internet Res,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7864774.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7864774/,

We investigated the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of delirium in NIV patients. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a teaching hospital. Patients in whom NIV was used as a first-line intervention were enrolled. During NIV intervention, delirium was screened using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU each day. The association between delirium and poor outcomes (e.g., NIV failure, ICU and hospital mortality) was investigated using forward stepwise multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: We enrolled 1083 patients. Of these, 196 patients (18.1%) experienced delirium during NIV intervention. Patients with delirium had higher NIV failure rates (37.8% vs. 21.0%, p < 0.01), higher ICU mortality (33.2% vs. 14.3%, p < 0.01), and higher hospital mortality (37.2% vs. 17.0%, p < 0.01) than subjects without delirium. They also had a longer duration of NIV (median 6.3 vs. 3.7 days, p < 0.01), and stayed longer in the ICU (median 9.0 vs. 6.0 days, p < 0.01) and the hospital (median 14.5 vs. 11.0 days, p < 0.01). These results were confirmed in COPD and non-COPD cohorts. According to subtype, compared to hyperactive delirium patients, hypoactive and mixed delirium patients spent more days and many more days on NIV (median 3.4 vs. 6.5 vs. 10.1 days, p < 0.01). Similar outcomes were found for length of stay in the ICU and hospital. However, NIV failure, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality did not differ among the three subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is associated with increases in poor outcomes (NIV failure, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality) and the use of medical resources (duration of NIV, and lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital). Regarding subtype, hypoactive and mixed delirium are associated with higher, and much higher, consumption of medical resources, respectively, compared to hyperactive delirium.

We found that allogeneic MSCs exhibit lower persistence in naïve compared to irradiated animals, and that intraperitoneal infusion of IFNγ prelicensed allogeneic MSCs protected animals from radiation induced lethality by day 30. In direct comparison, we also investigated the effect of IFNγ prelicensed allogeneic MSCs in modulating acute GvHD in an animal model of MHC major mismatched bone marrow transplantation. Infusion of IFNγ prelicensed allogeneic MSCs failed to mitigate acute GvHD.

This leads to stress and subsequently to pecking and cannibalism. Environmental enrichment is suggested to reduce stress and feather pecking, thus leading to an increase of the overall flock health. However, the effect of increasing age on the use of enrichment elements and on the behavior repertoire as well as its correlation with health parameters has scarcely been studied. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the influence of environmental enrichment on the behavioral repertoire and on health parameters of turkeys. In 3 consecutive trials, female turkeys were housed up to 12 wk either in an unstructured (control group) or enriched environment (EE group) featuring elevated plateaus at different levels (“turkey tree”). Behavior parameters, clinical health, and immune parameters were determined at selected time points. The percentage of birds using the turkey tree increased with age up to 55 to 77% at 22 to 30 d post hatch (dph). Thereafter, the number of birds located on the turkey tree decreased to 25 to 32% at 73 to 79 dph. Feather pecking and fighting was significantly lower in the EE group compared to the control group in 2 and 3 trials, respectively (P < 0.05). The integrity of feathers and integument, scored in the head/neck, wing, and tail regions was repeatedly better in the EE birds compared to control birds at most investigated time points (P < 0.05), suggesting a reduction in stress related aggression by the use of the turkey tree. Head pecking, running and flying activity, foraging, and preening were overall comparable between the EE and the control group (P > 0.05). Humoral immunity as determined by vaccination-induced anti-Newcastle disease virus antibody titers was not affected by the turkey tree use. The flow cytometric evaluation of blood monocyte and T-lymphocyte numbers showed no repeatable difference between control and EE groups.

AIM: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and determinants of hypertension in a rural agrarian community in Edo North, Nigeria. SETTING: The study was carried out in Ayua, a community in Edo North, southern Nigeria. METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study involved the use of a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire to obtain relevant data. Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and glucose were recorded. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. RESULTS: Two hundred and nineteen participants aged > 15 years completed the study with a mean age of 54.03 ± 16.61 years and females comprising 159 (72.6%) of the total. The prevalence of hypertension was 27.9% (in 61 participants). Twenty-one (9.8%) respondents gave a family history of hypertension. The mean BMI amongst respondents was 27.10 ± 6.61 kg/m(2). Obesity and pre-obesity were found in 58 (26.5%) and 71(32.4%) respondents, respectively. The determinants of hypertension were age and BMI. Compared with those who were less than 40 years old, those aged 40–65 years and > 65 years had 1.9 and 4.2 times increased odds of developing hypertension, respectively. Similarly, compared with the non-obese, obese participants had 2.3 times increased odd of having hypertension. CONCLUSION: Hypertension was highly prevalent in this rural community.

In the field of veterinary medical big data, information collected from companion animals, primarily dogs, can be used to inform healthcare decisions in both dogs and other species. Currently, veterinary medical datasets are an underused resource for translational research, but recent advances in data collection in this population have helped to make these data more accessible for use in translational studies. The largest open access dataset in the United States is part of the Dog Aging Project and includes detailed information about individual dog participant’s physical and chemical environments, diet, exercise, behavior, and comprehensive health history. These data are collected longitudinally and at regular intervals over the course of the dog’s lifespan. Large-scale datasets such as this can be used to inform our understanding of health, disease, and how to increase healthy lifespan. ABSTRACT: Dogs provide an ideal model for study as they have the most phenotypic diversity and known naturally occurring diseases of all non-human land mammals. Thus, data related to dog health present many opportunities to discover insights into health and disease outcomes. Here, we describe several sources of veterinary medical big data that can be used in research. These sources include medical records from primary medical care centers or referral hospitals, medical claims data from animal insurance companies, and datasets constructed specifically for research purposes. No data source provides information that is without limitations, but large-scale, prospective, longitudinally collected data from dog populations are ideal for further research as they offer many advantages over other data sources.",2021-06-23,"Paynter, Ashley N.; Dunbar, Matthew D.; Creevy, Kate E.; Ruple, Audrey",Animals (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/afb119266d97624812148e8c13df57e0cedf9565.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8300140.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8300140/,

Methods: Ninety-one subjects (mean age = 70.29 ± 7.70 years)—healthy older adults (HCs, n = 23), patients with single-domain amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n = 23), patients with single-domain executive Parkinson's disease MCI (PD-MCI, n = 20), and patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (mild AD, n = 25)—were enrolled in the study. All participants underwent cognitive evaluations performed using both traditional neuropsychological assessment tools, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Overall Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Smart Aging platform. We analyzed global scores on Smart Aging indices (i.e., accuracy, time, distance) as well as the Smart Aging total score, looking for differences between the four groups. Results: The findings revealed significant between-group differences in all the Smart Aging indices: accuracy (p < 0.001), time (p < 0.001), distance (p < 0.001), and total Smart Aging score (p < 0.001). The HCs outperformed the mild AD, aMCI, and PD-MCI patients in terms of accuracy, time, distance, and Smart Aging total score. In addition, the mild AD group was outperformed both by the HCs and by the aMCI and PD-MCI patients on accuracy and distance. No significant differences were found between aMCI and PD-MCI patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two single posterior restorations in 30 participants (18 women and 12 men aged 27 to 75 years) were placed into either a unilateral single-tooth defect (n = 17) or on either side of a bilateral teeth defects (n = 15). The bite force (%) of the prostheses, teeth and segments at the maximum intercuspation position (MIP) was evaluated using a T-scan at 5 stages (pre-placement, immediately following placement, and 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-placement). RESULTS: The occlusal force of implant-supported prostheses was significantly (P = .000) lower than those of the control natural teeth at the baseline, then no significant difference was found with that of the mesial teeth at 3 months, and finally it was significantly (P = .000) lower than that of the distal teeth at 6 months; meanwhile, it significantly (P = .008) increased by a mean of 2.04 times from 2 weeks (3.39 ± 2.61%) to 3 months (6.90 ± 4.77%), whereas no significant difference (P = .900) was found from 3 months (6.90 ± 4.77%) to 6 months (7.31 ± 4.60%).

Recent studies have shown the efficacy of rTM through its anti-inflammatory effects for treatment of adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the safety and efficacy of rTM in children with severe ARDS complicated by DIC have not been reported. In this preliminary study, we reported the feasibility of using rTM for the treatment of pneumonia-induced severe ARDS complicated by DIC in children. METHODS: Six children (age: median 10 months old) with pneumonia-induced severe ARDS complicated by DIC were enrolled in this preliminary study. rTM (380 U/kg) was administered for a maximum of 6 days, in addition to conventional therapies after diagnosis of severe ARDS complicated by DIC. After administration of rTM, we measured changes in the plasma TM concentration and evaluated the clinical course, status of DIC and ARDS, and other laboratory findings, including levels of cytokines, chemokines, and biomarkers. RESULTS: In all six children, the plasma concentration of TM increased and DIC scores decreased after administration of rTM. Four of the six children recovered from the severe ARDS complicated by DIC after treatment, and were discharged from the hospital with no complications. In survived children, levels of soluble receptors for advanced glycation end products, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 decreased after administration of rTM compared to those before rTM. CONCLUSIONS: The rTM administration is feasible as an adjunctive therapeutic strategy for children over 2 months with pneumonia-induced severe ARDS complicated by DIC.

Those who contract the influenza virus will typically develop a mild illness. However, for populations at a higher risk, including those diagnosed with dementia, influenza is proven to be more detrimental. Persons with dementia (PWD) face a serious threat to influenza on an annual basis, and vaccine hesitancy may further potentiate this risk. The purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the barriers PWD face in receiving the influenza vaccine. METHODS: A literature review was conducted to examine the barriers that prevent PWD from seeking out the annual influenza vaccine. A thematic analysis provided an understanding of the overarching relationships found among the influences between the identified themes. RESULTS: Three main influences were identified: (1) intra-personal, (2) inter-personal, and (3) extra-personal, with each influence containing several subsequent sub-themes. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The literature review found that there is a lack of research involving this high-risk population and the barriers they face, especially within the extra-personal influences.

VNN causes damage of necrosis and vacuolation to central nervous system (CNS) cells in fish. It is difficult to identify the specific type of cell targeted by NNV, and to decipher the host immune response because of the functional diversity and highly complex anatomical and cellular composition of the CNS. In this study, we found that the red spotted grouper NNV (RGNNV) mainly attacked the midbrain of orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). We conducted single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the midbrain of healthy and RGNNV-infected fish and identified 35 transcriptionally distinct cell subtypes, including 28 neuronal and 7 non-neuronal cell types. An evaluation of the subpopulations of immune cells revealed that macrophages were enriched in RGNNV-infected fish, and the transcriptional profiles of macrophages indicated an acute cytokine and inflammatory response.

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) protocols are widely used in adult emergency situations to diagnose and guide treatment, but none has been specifically developed for the neonate. We propose a targeted diagnostic ultrasound protocol for the suddenly decompensating infant in the NICU for rapid screening for the most common life-threatening complications needing immediate attention. We integrated current knowledge on the use of POCUS for diagnosis of the most critical neonatal complications into the “SAFE-R protocol” (Sonographic Assessment of liFe-threatening Emergencies — Revised). The ultrasound algorithm was evaluated at the bedside for suitability and ease of use. Main features of SAFE-R are the use of standardized ultrasound points and a simple one-probe rule-in/rule-out approach. The flowchart is designed by order of urgency and priority is given to treatable causes. Hence, ruling out cardiac tamponade is the first step in the decision tree, followed by pneumothorax, pleural effusion, then acute critical aortic occlusion, acute abdominal complications, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage. Conclusion: SAFE-R is the first ultrasound algorithm specifically conceived for use in the NICU to screen for the most common urgent neonatal complications leading to sudden deterioration, thereby providing critical information within minutes.

Considering their independent mechanisms of actions, there is a potential for significant synergy with combination therapy, yet limited data exist. This 32-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will gain mechanistic insight into the effects of coadministration of exenatide QW, a weekly subcutaneous GLP1-RA, with dapagliflozin, a once daily oral SGLT2i, on the dynamic, adaptive changes in energy balance, total, regional and organ-specific fat mass and multiorgan insulin sensitivity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 110 obese patients with diagnosed T2D (glycated haemoglobin, HbA(1c) ≥48 mmol/mol) will be treated for 32 weeks with dapagliflozin (10 mg once daily either alone or in combination with exenatide QW (2 mg once weekly); active treatments will be compared with a control group (placebo tablet and sham injection). The primary objective of the study is to compare the adjusted mean reduction in total body fat mass (determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DEXA) from baseline following 32 weeks of treatment with exenatide QW and dapagliflozin versus dapagliflozin alone compared with control (placebo). Secondary outcome measures include changes in (1) energy balance (energy intake and energy expenditure measured by indirect calorimetry); (2) appetite (between and within meals) and satiety quotient; (3) body composition including visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue, liver and pancreatic fat. Exploratory outcome measures include metabolic changes in hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity (using a two-stage hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic clamp), central nervous system responses to food images using blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) and changes in cardiovascular function (using transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac MR and duplex ultrasonography).

Method: Three-hundred-and-fifty-two patients with chronic tinnitus completed audiological testing and a psychological assessment battery that comprised—among other measures—German versions of the Tinnitus Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Somatic Symptom Scale-8, and Health-Related Quality of Life scale. Descriptive analyses examined associations as well as within- and between-gender differences of the measured variables. Gender-specific serial indirect effects analyses aimed to explain the impact of TRD on HRQoL through psychological processes, notably anxiety, depressive symptoms, and somatization symptoms. Results: Both female and male patients yielded lower mental than physical HRQoL and negative associations between the measured psychological variables and HRQoL. Compared to male patients, female patients reported higher levels of tinnitus-related- and wider psychological distress, other somatization symptoms (e.g., headaches), and impairments in mental and physical HRQoL. For each gender, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and somatization symptoms fully mediated the effect of TRD on mental and physical HRQoL. A double-dissociation revealed an interaction of somatization symptoms and depression on the TRD-HRQoL association in women, and of somatization symptoms and anxiety in men.

Temperature is a major driver for many vector-borne diseases including Bluetongue viral (BTV) disease, a midge-borne febrile disease of ruminants, notably livestock, whose etiology ranges from mild or asymptomatic to rapidly fatal, thus threatening animal agriculture and the economy of affected countries. Using modeling tools, we seek to predict where the transmission can occur based on suitable temperatures for BTV. We fit thermal performance curves to temperature-sensitive midge life-history traits, using a Bayesian approach. We incorporate these curves into S(T), a transmission suitability metric derived from the disease’s basic reproductive number, [Formula: see text] This suitability metric encompasses all components that are known to be temperature-dependent. We use trait responses for two species of key midge vectors, Culicoides sonorensis and Culicoides variipennis present in North America. Our results show that outbreaks of BTV are more likely between 15[Formula: see text] C and [Formula: see text] , with predicted peak transmission risk at 26 [Formula: see text] C. The greatest uncertainty in S(T) is associated with the following: the uncertainty in mortality and fecundity of midges near optimal temperature for transmission; midges’ probability of becoming infectious post-infection at the lower edge of the thermal range; and the biting rate together with vector competence at the higher edge of the thermal range. We compare three model formulations and show that incorporating thermal curves into all three leads to similar BTV risk predictions. To demonstrate the utility of this modeling approach, we created global suitability maps indicating the areas at high and long-term risk of BTV transmission, to assess risk and to anticipate potential locations of disease establishment.

Carbapenems are among the most potent antimicrobial agents that are commercially available to treat MDR bacteria. Bacterial production of carbapenem-hydrolysing metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) challenges their safety and efficacy, with subclass B1 MBLs hydrolysing almost all β-lactam antibiotics. MBL inhibitors would fulfil an urgent clinical need by prolonging the lifetime of these life-saving drugs. Here we report the synthesis and activity of a series of 2-mercaptomethyl-thiazolidines (MMTZs), designed to replicate MBL interactions with reaction intermediates or hydrolysis products. MMTZs are potent competitive inhibitors of B1 MBLs in vitro (e.g., K(i) = 0.44 μM vs. NDM-1). Crystal structures of MMTZ complexes reveal similar binding patterns to the most clinically important B1 MBLs (NDM-1, VIM-2 and IMP-1), contrasting with previously studied thiol-based MBL inhibitors, such as bisthiazolidines (BTZs) or captopril stereoisomers, which exhibit lower, more variable potencies and multiple binding modes. MMTZ binding involves thiol coordination to the Zn(ii) site and extensive hydrophobic interactions, burying the inhibitor more deeply within the active site than d/l-captopril. Unexpectedly, MMTZ binding features a thioether–π interaction with a conserved active-site aromatic residue, consistent with their equipotent inhibition and similar binding to multiple MBLs. MMTZs penetrate multiple Enterobacterales, inhibit NDM-1 in situ, and restore carbapenem potency against clinical isolates expressing B1 MBLs. Based on their inhibitory profile and lack of eukaryotic cell toxicity, MMTZs represent a promising scaffold for MBL inhibitor development. These results also suggest sulphur–π interactions can be exploited for general ligand design in medicinal chemistry.",2021-01-05,"Rossi, Maria-Agustina; Martinez, Veronica; Hinchliffe, Philip; Mojica, Maria F.; Castillo, Valerie; Moreno, Diego M.; Smith, Ryan; Spellberg, Brad; Drusano, George L.; Banchio, Claudia; Bonomo, Robert A.; Spencer, James; Vila, Alejandro J.; Mahler, Graciela",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e107336cb4ffd7e48ea088750afb1b3bc7a1158b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8b338413354eda2199bd9abc27868081cc79f55f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8179362.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8179362/,

The aim of this study was to present the treatment reality of aortic diseases based on the aortic interventions recorded in Switzerland’s vascular registry Swissvasc. METHODS: All interventions on the aorta that were carried out between January 2018 and December 2020 in Switzerland and entered in the Swissvasc registry were included in this overview. Interventions for the treatment of isolated pathologies of the iliac vessels as well as interventions on the ascending aorta and the proximal aortic arch were excluded. RESULTS: Open aortic surgery was performed in 28 hospitals and endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) in 33. Just under half of these hospitals achieved the recommended minimum number of cases for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) of 30 open and endovascular interventions per year, which are currently discussed in the literature. In line with the literature 67% of the elective treatments for AAA were performed by EVAR. Corresponding to the current literature, 11% of the AAA were ruptured in the 3‑year observation period. In contrast to the recommendations of the current guidelines almost 60% of the ruptured AAA were treated by open repair. There was a certain tendency for a spontaneous centralization in the treatment of thoracic aortic pathologies as 87% of the interventions were carried out in only 5 hospitals. CONCLUSION: This study shows that many clinics in Switzerland treat aortic pathologies, some with a very small caseload. Further investigations of the quality of care in the treatment of aortic pathologies are urgently needed.",2021-06-01,"Meuli, L.; Lattmann, T.",Gefasschirurgie,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/84b0dcc2b305863a8258461d71dc44fd7e806824.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8168293.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8168293/,

Altoida’s Digital Neuro Signature (DNS), a longitudinal cognitive test consisting of two active digital biomarker metrics, alleviates these limitations. By comparison to conventional neuropsychological assessments, DNS results in faster evaluations (10 min vs 45–120 min), and generates higher test-retest in intraindividual assessment, as well as higher accuracy at detecting abnormal cognition. This study comparatively evaluates the performance of Altoida’s DNS and conventional neuropsychological assessments in intraindividual assessments of cognition and function by means of two semi-naturalistic observational experiments with 525 participants in laboratory and clinical settings. The results show that DNS is consistently more sensitive than conventional neuropsychological assessments at capturing longitudinal individual-level change, both with respect to intraindividual variability and dispersion (intraindividual variability across multiple tests), across three participant groups: healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease. Dispersion differences between DNS and conventional neuropsychological assessments were more pronounced with more advanced disease stages, and DNS-intraindividual variability was able to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. These findings are instrumental for patient monitoring and management, remote clinical trial assessment, and timely interventions, and will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of Alzheimer’s disease.",2021-06-24,"Meier, Irene B.; Buegler, Max; Harms, Robbert; Seixas, Azizi; Çöltekin, Arzu; Tarnanas, Ioannis",NPJ Digit Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ecdfff536ebacb0063ab2464434901e9b21527bc.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8225898.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8225898/,

A few studies suggest that increased concentration of pro-inflammatory biomarkers may be related to olfactory deficits, but these associations are understudied in population-based samples. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and olfactory identification level as well as rate of change in aging. METHODS: We included 1,721 participants (mean age 70.5 years; 61.9% female) with at least two olfactory assessments across the 12-year follow-up. Baseline level and change in odor identification were estimated with linear mixed models as a function of CRP levels, derived from blood plasma at baseline. RESULTS: Results indicated a negative dose–response association between CRP level and odor identification scores at baseline, after adjustment for demographic, cognitive, health, and lifestyle factors. CRP levels ranging between 11 and 20 mg/L were significantly related to lower olfactory ability (β = −0.811, 95% confidence interval [CI] [−1.503 to −0.118]; p = .022). Likewise, CRP values above 20 mg/L were related to lower olfactory scores, an association that approached statistical significance (β = −0.996, 95% CI [−2.045 to 0.054]; p = .063). We found no associations between CRP and olfactory change (ps > .368). Sensitivity analyses showed that associations between CRP and olfaction were confined to younger participants (age ≤72 years) and men (ps < .034).

A systematic literature review was conducted to better understand the burden of AA from the patient perspective. METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched for published studies (2008–2018) reporting on assessments of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients with AA. Qualitative, and quantitative data were collected. RESULTS: The review included 37 studies encompassing a range of clinical outcome assessment (COA) tools. None of the COA tools were specific for AA, and only one study used the Hairdex scale, which was designed to evaluate HRQoL in patients with disorders of the hair and scalp. All studies reported substantial impact on HRQoL due to AA, both overall and in domains related to personality (i.e. temperament and character), emotions and social functioning. Acute stress was also noted, and several studies identified lack of emotional awareness (alexithymia) in 23–50% of the patients with AA. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is well-established that patients with AA experience anxiety and depression, they also experience a decrease in HRQoL in many other areas, including personality, emotions, behaviors and social functioning, and these changes may be accompanied by acute stress and alexithymia. There is a need to achieve consensus on a core set of measures for AA and to develop and validate AA-specific measurement tools for use in future studies, to attain a clearer understanding of the impact of AA on patients.

By designing an efficient hospital management platform to quickly identify the corresponding chronic diseases, it can effectively reduce the labor cost, improve the accuracy of disease identification, and improve treatment efficiency. ADHD is a common behavioral disorder in school-age children, and it is also one of the most common chronic health problems in this period. The internationally recognized prevalence of ADHD is 3%–9%. ADHD often brings adverse effects on children's life and studying and at the same time increases difficulties for their families. Therefore, this paper designs an intelligent management platform for public hospitals based on a deep learning algorithm, evaluates the current situation and influencing factors of ADHD children through the child adaptive behavior scale and the family function assessment scale, and designs its intelligent platform by using a new technology of fNIRS. According to the nonlinearity and unsteadiness of the fNIRS signal, this paper proposes a motion noise removal method based on EMD algorithm methods: to automatically identify children with ADHD and improve the cognitive function of children with ADHD by intervention technology. The data are from the outpatients of the Department of Child Psychology of the First People's Hospital of Tianshui City in Gansu Province in 2018. The results showed that there were significant differences in the adaptive behavior scale (CABS) and fad scores between the two groups. In the seven dimensions of family function, there were significant differences between the two groups (P < 0.01). fNIRS management platform can effectively identify ADHD patients with high recognition accuracy. The intelligent management platform can significantly reduce the number of physical examination personnel, prolong the diagnosis and treatment time, reduce a lot of repetitive work, and improve the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment. At the same time, this technology also provides great help for better research and improvement of ADHD patients and provides a reference for the information intelligent construction of modern hospitals.",2021-06-04,"Zhao, Hongyi; Chen, Jiangyu; Lin, Yiqi",J Healthc Eng,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/905d036638ba5abb21b1aee210df65ad1b6fe9be.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8195640.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8195640/,

Evidence suggests that the global dietary patterns may represent a tool in counteracting oxidative stress, thus preventing the onset of diseases related to oxidative stress. More specifically, dietary patterns based on the regular consumption of fruits and vegetables (i.e., Mediterranean diet) have been licensed by various national nutritional guidelines in many countries for their health-promoting effects. Such patterns, indeed, result in being rich in specific components, such as fiber, minerals, vitamins and antioxidants, whose beneficial effects on human health have been widely reported. This suggests a potential nutraceutical power of specific dietary components. In this manuscript, we summarize the most relevant evidence reporting the impact of dietary antioxidants on gut microbiota composition, inflammation and obesity, and we underline that antioxidants are implicated in a complex interplay between gut microbiota, inflammation and obesity, thus suggesting their possible role in the development and modulation of chronic diseases related to oxidative stress and in the maintenance of wellness.

Novel approaches to detect early signs of elevated CVD risk in women are needed. Enhancement of traditional CVD risk assessment approaches through the addition of procedures to assess physical function or frailty as well as novel biomarkers of cardiovascular, gut and muscle health could improve early identification. The Women’s Advanced Risk-assessment in Manitoba (WARM) Hearts study will examine the use of novel non-invasive assessments and biomarkers to identify women who are at elevated risk for adverse cardiovascular events. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: One thousand women 55 years of age or older will be recruited and screened by the WARM Hearts observational, cohort study. The two screening appointments will include assessments of medical history, gender variables, body composition, cognition, frailty status, functional fitness, physical activity levels, nutritional status, quality of life questionnaires, sleep behaviour, resting blood pressure (BP), BP response to moderate-intensity exercise, a non-invasive measure of arterial stiffness and heart rate variability. Blood sample analysis will be used to assess lipid and novel biomarker profiles and stool samples will support the characterisation of gut microbiota. The incidence of the adverse cardiovascular outcomes will be assessed 5 years after screening to compare WARM Hearts approaches to the Framingham Risk Score, the current clinical standard of assessing CVD risk in Canada. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The University of Manitoba Health Research Ethics Board (7 October 2019) and the St Boniface Hospital Research Review Committee (7 October 2019) approved the trial (Ethics Number HS22576 (H2019:063)).

These structures emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at sites marked by the protein seipin, but the mechanisms regulating their biogenesis remain poorly understood. Using a combination of molecular simulations, yeast genetics, and fluorescence microscopy, we show that interactions between lipids’ acyl-chains modulate the propensity of NLs to be stored in LDs, in turn preventing or promoting their accumulation in the ER membrane. Our data suggest that diacylglycerol, which is enriched at sites of LD formation, promotes the packaging of NLs into LDs, together with ER-abundant lipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine. On the opposite end, short and saturated acyl-chains antagonize fat storage in LDs and promote accumulation of NLs in the ER.

Glial cells, on the other hand, can divide and repopulate themselves under injury or diseased conditions. We have previously reported that ectopic expression of NeuroD1 in dividing glial cells can directly convert them into neurons. Here, using astrocytic lineage-tracing reporter mice (Aldh1l1-CreER(T2) mice crossing with Ai14 mice), we demonstrate that lineage-traced astrocytes can be successfully converted into NeuN-positive neurons after expressing NeuroD1 through adeno-associated viruses. Retroviral expression of NeuroD1 further confirms that dividing glial cells can be converted into neurons. Importantly, we demonstrate that for in vivo cell conversion study, using a safe level of adeno-associated virus dosage (10(10)–10(12) gc/mL, 1 µL) in the rodent brain is critical to avoid artifacts caused by toxic dosage, such as that used in a recent bioRxiv study (2 × 10(13) gc/mL, 1 µL, mouse cortex). For therapeutic purpose under injury or diseased conditions, or for non-human primate studies, adeno-associated virus dosage needs to be optimized through a series of dose-finding experiments. Moreover, for future in vivo glia-to-neuron conversion studies, we recommend that the adeno-associated virus results are further verified with retroviruses that mainly express transgenes in dividing glial cells in order to draw solid conclusions.

There has been substantial progress identifying antigens and vaccine vectors that lead to strong and broad T cell responses, tailoring vaccine designs to achieve optimal antigen presentation, and finding combination partners employing complementary mechanisms of action (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors) to overcome the diverse methods cancer cells use to evade and suppress the immune system. Results from randomized, phase 3 studies testing therapeutic cancer vaccines based on these advances are eagerly awaited.

Several lines of evidence indicate that statins regulate multiple proteins associated with the regulation of differing cellular pathways. The 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway plays an important role in metabolism homeostasis with effects on cellular processes including apoptosis and the inflammatory responses through several pathways. Recently, it has been shown that statins can affect the AMPK pathway in differing physiological and pathological ways, resulting in anti-cancer, cardio-protective, neuro-protective, and anti-tubercular effects; additionally, they have therapeutic effects on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes mellitus-associated complications. Statins activate AMPK as an energy sensor that inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in cancer cells, whilst exerting its cardio-protective effects through inhibition of inflammation and fibrosis, and promotion of angiogenesis. Furthermore, statin-associated AMPK activation leads to decreased lipid accumulation and decreased amyloid beta deposition in the liver and brain, respectively, and may have therapeutic effects on the liver and neurons.

Curcuma is widely used in treating malaria, UC, Crohn's disease, and colon cancer, which lead to diarrhea and bloody stool. However, the systemic mechanism of curcuma in treating UC is still unclear. Our work was supposed to expound how does curcuma alleviate UC in a comprehensive and systematic way by network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experiment verification. METHODS: Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database (TCMSP), Shanghai Chemistry & Chemical Industry Data Platform (SGST), and papers published in Chinese Network Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and PubMed were used to collect the chemical constituents of curcuma based on ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion). And effective targets were predicted by Swiss Target Prediction to establish the curcuma-related database. The disease targets of UC were screened by GeneCards and DrugBank databases, and Wayne (Venn) analysis was carried out with curcuma targets to determine the intersection targets. AutoDock software and TCMNPAS system were used to dock the core chemical components of curcuma with key UC targets. Protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on the STRING database and Cytoscape software. Gene function GO analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were carried out by using Metascape database. Finally, HE staining was performed to identify the inflammatory infiltration and expression difference in TNF-α and STAT3 before and after the treatment of curcuma which was verified by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Twelve active components containing 148 target genes were selected from curcuma. Potential therapeutic targets of curcuma in the treatment of UC were acquired from 54 overlapped targets from UC and curcuma. Molecular docking was used to filter the exact 24 core proteins interacting with compounds whose docking energy is lower than −5.5 and stronger than that of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). GO and KEGG analyses showed that these targets were highly correlated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Experiments verified curcuma relieved pathological manifestation and decreased the expression of TNF-α and STAT3.

The present paper identified and characterised five SQE genes (GgSQE1 to GgSQE5) from Glycyrrhiza glabra through transcriptome data mining and homology-based cloning, for the first time. The phylogenetic analysis implied their functional divergence. The ORF corresponding to one of the five SQEs, namely, GgSQE1, was cloned and studied for its function in a heterologous system, following transient and stable expressions. The transient expression followed by GgSQE1 encoding protein purification suggested approximately 58.0-kDa protein following the predicted molecular mass of the deduced protein. The gene expression profiling based on qRT-PCR indicated its highest expression (6.4-folds) in the 10-month-old roots. Furthermore, ABA (12.4-folds) and GA(3) (2.47) treatments upregulated the expression of GgSQE1 in the shoots after 10 and 12 hours, respectively, which was also reflected in glycyrrhizin accumulation. The inductive effects of ABA and GA(3) over GgSQE1 expression were also confirmed through functional analysis of GgSQE1 promoters using GUS fusion construct.

Intracellular acetyl-CoA concentrations are associated with nutrient availability, but the mechanisms by which a cell responds to fluctuations in acetyl-CoA levels remain elusive. Here, we generate a cell system to selectively manipulate the nucleo-cytoplasmic levels of acetyl-CoA using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-mediated gene editing and acetate supplementation of the culture media. Using this system and quantitative omics analyses, we demonstrate that acetyl-CoA depletion alters the integrity of the nucleolus, impairing ribosomal RNA synthesis and evoking the ribosomal protein-dependent activation of p53. This nucleolar remodeling appears to be mediated through the class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs).

HTLV-1 has currently infected up to 10 million globally with highly endemic areas in Japan, Africa, the Caribbean and South America. We have previously shown that Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) enhance HTLV-1 transmission by promoting cell–cell contact. RESULTS: Here, we separated EVs into subpopulations using differential ultracentrifugation (DUC) at speeds of 2 k (2000×g), 10 k (10,000×g), and 100 k (100,000×g) from infected cell supernatants. Proteomic analysis revealed that EVs contain the highest viral/host protein abundance in the 2 k subpopulation (2 k > 10 k > 100 k). The 2 k and 10 k populations contained viral proteins (i.e., p19 and Tax), and autophagy proteins (i.e., LC3 and p62) suggesting presence of autophagosomes as well as core histones. Interestingly, the use of 2 k EVs in an angiogenesis assay (mesenchymal stem cells + endothelial cells) caused deterioration of vascular-like-tubules. Cells commonly associated with the neurovascular unit (i.e., astrocytes, neurons, and macrophages) in the blood–brain barrier (BBB) showed that HTLV-1 EVs may induce expression of cytokines involved in migration (i.e., IL-8; 100 k > 2 k > 10 k) from astrocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (i.e., IL-8; 2 k > 10 k). Finally, we found that EVs were able to promote cell–cell contact and viral transmission in monocytic cell-derived dendritic cell. The EVs from both 2 k and 10 k increased HTLV-1 spread in a humanized mouse model, as evidenced by an increase in proviral DNA and RNA in the Blood, Lymph Node, and Spleen.

We determined which induction medications were used most frequently for adult trauma RSIs and their associations with hemodynamics and outcomes. We hypothesized that etomidate is the most commonly used induction agent and has similar outcomes to other induction agents. METHODS: This retrospective review at two U.S. level I trauma centers evaluated adult trauma patients undergoing RSI within 24 h of admission, between 01/01/2016 and 12/31/2017. We compared patient characteristics and outcomes by induction agent. Comparisons on the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality and secondary outcomes of peri-intubation hypotension, hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS), ventilator days, and complications used logistic regression or negative binomial regression. Regression models adjusted for hospital site, age, patient severity measures, and intubation location. RESULTS: Among 1303 trauma patients undergoing RSI within 24 h of admission, 948 (73%) were intubated in the emergency department (ED) and 325 (25%) in the operating room (OR). The most common induction agents were etomidate (68%), propofol (17%), and ketamine (11%). In-hospital mortality was highest in the etomidate group (25.5%), followed by ketamine (17%), and propofol (1.8%).

Neuroinflammation is characterized by the microglia activation and concomitant production of pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to an increasing neuronal cell death. The decreased neuroinflammation could be obtained by using natural compounds, including flavonoids known to modulate the inflammatory responses. Among flavonoids, quercetin possess multiple pharmacological applications including anti-inflammatory, antitumoral, antiapoptotic and anti-thrombotic activities, widely demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In this review, we describe the recent findings about the neuroprotective action of quercetin by acting with different mechanisms on the microglial cells of CNS. The ability of quercetin to influence microRNA expression represents an interesting skill in the regulation of inflammation, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and immune responses. Moreover, in order to enhance quercetin bioavailability and capacity to target the brain, we discuss an innovative drug delivery system.

Functional evaluation of the diaphragm is challenging. Use of volitional maneuvers to test the diaphragm can be limited by patient effort. Non-volitional tests such as those using neuromuscular stimulation are technically complex, since the muscle itself is relatively inaccessible. As such, there is a growing interest in using imaging techniques to characterize diaphragm muscle dysfunction. Selecting the appropriate imaging technique for a given clinical scenario is a critical step in the evaluation of patients suspected of having diaphragm dysfunction. In this review, we aim to present a detailed analysis of evidence for the use of ultrasound and non-ultrasound imaging techniques in the assessment of diaphragm dysfunction. We highlight the utility of the qualitative information gathered by ultrasound imaging as a means to assess integrity, excursion, thickness, and thickening of the diaphragm. In contrast, quantitative ultrasound analysis of the diaphragm is marred by inherent limitations of this technique, and we provide a detailed examination of these limitations. We evaluate non-ultrasound imaging modalities that apply static techniques (chest radiograph, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging), used to assess muscle position, shape and dimension. We also evaluate non-ultrasound imaging modalities that apply dynamic imaging (fluoroscopy and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging) to assess diaphragm motion. Finally, we critically review the application of each of these techniques in the clinical setting when diaphragm dysfunction is suspected.

Circular RNA (circRNA) is a type of non-coding RNA that plays an important role in regulating cellular metabolism. However, whether and how circRNA is involved in regulating immune responses in the goat lung has not been reported. Thus, this study was designed to examine the function of circRNA in goats infected with Pasteurella multocida. Goats were assigned into one of two groups: an uninfected control group (CK) and an infected group challenged with P. multocida. Compared with the CK group, which remained healthy, the infected goats showed clinical signs of infection, including depression, cough, nasal discharge, and dyspnea, along with elevated body temperature and lesions in the lung. Whole-transcriptome sequencing and small RNA sequencing were then performed using lung samples from goats from each group. A total of 138 circRNA, 56 microRNAs (miRNA), and 2,673 messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules were significantly differentially expressed in the P. multocida-infected group compared with the CK group. Randomly selected differentially expressed circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA molecules (n = 5 per group) were then validated by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the source genes indicated that six immune-related terms were enriched among the differentially expressed cirRNA molecules, including inflammatory response, immune effector process, cell activation involved in immune response, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, response to endogenous stimulus, and immune response. The corresponding circRNA molecules were then selected for construction of a competitive endogenous RNA network to identify networks that may be involved in the immune response to P. multocida infection. The results indicated that P. multocida HN01 may cause pneumonia and stimulate an immune response in goats via regulation of circRNA expression.

The analysis of LV rotational deformation is challenging and requires standardization of image acquisition as well as postprocessing analysis. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility to analyse LV rotational deformation using 2DSTE by introducing a novel algorithm for the detection of artefacts. The study was performed in 20 healthy subjects serving as a control group and in 53 competitive sportsmen. Circumferential, radial strain (CS, RS) and LV rotation were analysed by 2DSTE in parasternal short axis views. The stepwise algorithm to exclude potential artefacts starts with the visual estimation of the image quality with respect to complete visualization of all myocardial segments during the entire cardiac cycle followed by the exclusion of data sets in participants with conduction abnormalities. The next step is the optimization of tracking areas and a cross-check of implausible strain waveforms in multiple acquired comparable cineloops. The last step is the exclusion of strain curves with persisting implausible waveforms if standardization failures and incorrect LV wall tracking are fixed. Plausible physiological strain curves were observed in 89% (n = 65/73) of all subjects. In controls all implausible waveforms could be verified as artefacts. The algorithm was applied in 53 professional athletes to test and confirm its feasibility. Abnormal CS waveforms were documented in 25 athletes, verified as artefacts due to tracking failures in 22 athletes and due to incorrect image acquisition in 3 athletes. CS artefacts were mostly located in the basal posterior and lateral LV segments. (endocardial: 6%, n = 4/70; p < 0.05) and basal posterior (endocardial: 8%, n = 5/70; p < 0.05) segments were highly susceptible to artefacts. 2DSTE of parasternal short axis views to analyse circumferential and radial deformation as well as LV rotation is feasible in athletes. The proposed algorithm helps to avoid artefacts and might contribute to standardization of this technique. 2DSTE might provide an interesting diagnostic tool for the detection of viral myocarditis, e.g. in athletes.

STUDY DESIGN: A comprehensive review of the literature was performed, followed by a detailed analysis of the relevant data that has been published on the topic. METHODS: Clinical key, Uptodate, Ovid, Ebscohost, Pubmed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Dynamed, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library were systematically searched. Once the search was completed, dynamic sleep MRI data were analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen articles reported on 410 OSA patients and 79 controls that underwent dynamic sleep MRI and were included in this review. For meta-analysis of dynamic sleep MRI data, eight articles presented relevant data on 160 OSA patients. Obstruction was reported as follows: retropalatal (RP) 98%, retroglossal (RG) 41% and hypopharyngeal (HP) in 5%. Lateral pharyngeal wall (LPW) collapse was found in 35/73 (48%) patients. The combinations of RP + RG were observed in 24% and RP + RG + LPW in 16%. If sedation was used, 98% of study participants fell asleep compared to 66% of unsedated participants. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic sleep MRI has demonstrated that nearly all patients have retropalatal obstruction, retroglossal obstruction is common and hypopharyngeal obstruction is rare. Nearly all patients (98%) who are sedated are able to fall asleep during the MRI. There is significant heterogeneity in the literature and standardization is needed.

This study aimed to assess the capacity of dynamic flat-panel detector (FPD) imaging without the use of contrast media to estimate cardiovascular parameters based on image parameters of a porcine model under fluid loading. Three domestic pigs were intubated, and mechanical ventilation was provided using a ventilator under anesthesia. A porcine model involving circulatory changes induced by fluid loading (fluid infusion/blood removal) was developed. Sequential chest radiographs of the pigs were obtained using a dynamic FPD system within the first 5 min after fluid loading. Image parameters such as the size of the heart shadow and mean pixel values in the lungs were measured, and correlations between fluid loading and cardiovascular parameters (blood pressure [BP], cardiac output [CO], central venous pressure [CVP], and pulmonary arterial pressure [PAP]) were analyzed based on freedom-adjusted coefficients of determination (R(f)(2)). Fluid loading was correlated with radiographic lung density and the size of the heart shadow. Radiographic lung density was correlated with the left and right heart system-related parameters BP, CO, CVP, and PAP. The size of the heart shadow correlated with the left heart system-related parameters CO and BP. Dynamic FPD imaging allows for the relative evaluation of cardiovascular parameters based on image parameters.

To date, only a few adjuvants have been approved for use in humans, among which aluminum-containing adjuvants are the only ones widely used. However, the medical need for potent and safe adjuvants is currently continuously increasing, especially those triggering cellular immune responses for cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation, which are urgently needed for the development of efficient virus and cancer vaccines. Manganese is an essential micronutrient required for diverse biological activities, but its functions in immunity remain undefined. We previously reported that Mn(2+) is important in the host defense against cytosolic dsDNA by facilitating cGAS-STING activation and that Mn(2+) alone directly activates cGAS independent of dsDNA, leading to an unconventional catalytic synthesis of 2′3′-cGAMP. Herein, we found that Mn(2+) strongly promoted immune responses by facilitating antigen uptake, presentation, and germinal center formation via both cGAS-STING and NLRP3 activation. Accordingly, a colloidal manganese salt (Mn jelly, MnJ) was formulated to act not only as an immune potentiator but also as a delivery system to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses, inducing antibody production and CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell proliferation and activation by either intramuscular or intranasal immunization. When administered intranasally, MnJ also worked as a mucosal adjuvant, inducing high levels of secretory IgA. MnJ showed good adjuvant effects for all tested antigens, including T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antigens, such as bacterial capsular polysaccharides, thus indicating that it is a promising adjuvant candidate.",2021-03-25,"Zhang, Rui; Wang, Chenguang; Guan, Yukun; Wei, Xiaoming; Sha, Mengyin; Yi, Mengran; Jing, Miao; Lv, Mengze; Guo, Wen; Xu, Jing; Wan, Yi; Jia, Xin-Ming; Jiang, Zhengfan",Cell Mol Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/796359533b1affbc3ebe13fc7e9b164f76d73831.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8dc434df20cb7b487f4267fe5f2e396407ed4dfe.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8093200.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8093200/,

METHODS: During July 1(st) and December 31(th) 2019, participants were prospectively derived from the ‘Zhongshan Cardiovascular Surgery Cohort’. NLPR was determined using neutrophil counts, lymphocyte and platelet count at the two-time points. Dose-response relationship analyses were applied to delineate the non-linear odds ratio (OR) of CSA-AKI in different NLPR levels. Then NLPRs were integrated into the generalized estimating equation (GEE) to predict the risk of AKI. RESULTS: Of 2449 patients receiving cardiovascular surgery, 838 (34.2%) cases developed CSA-AKI with stage 1 (n = 658, 26.9%), stage 2–3 (n = 180, 7.3%). Compared with non-AKI patients, both preoperative and postoperative NLPR were higher in AKI patients (1.1[0.8, 1.8] vs. 0.9[0.7,1.4], p < 0.001; 12.4[7.5, 20.0] vs. 10.1[6.4,16.7], p < 0.001). Such an effect was a ‘J’-shaped relationship: CSA-AKI’s risk was relatively flat until 1.0 of preoperative NLPR and increased rapidly afterward, with an odds ratio of 1.13 (1.06–1.19) per 1 unit. Similarly, patients whose postoperative NLPR value >11.0 were more likely to develop AKI with an OR of 1.02. Integrating the dynamic NLPRs into the GEE model, we found that the AUC was 0.806(95% CI 0.793–0.819), which was significantly higher than the AUC without NLPR (0.799, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Dynamics of perioperative NPLR is a promising marker for predicting acute kidney injury.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors and sulfonylureas associated with the risk of all-cause mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes using metformin. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cohort study used data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs compared the use of SGLT2 inhibitors vs sulfonylureas in individuals receiving metformin for treatment of type 2 diabetes. A total of 23 870 individuals with new use of SGLT2 inhibitors and 104 423 individuals with new use of sulfonylureas were enrolled between October 1, 2016, and February 29, 2020, and followed up until January 31, 2021. EXPOSURES: New use of SGLT2 inhibitors or sulfonylureas. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This study examined the outcome of all-cause mortality. Predefined variables and covariates identified by a high-dimensional variable selection algorithm were used to build propensity scores. The overlap weighting method based on the propensity scores was used to estimate the intention-to-treat effect sizes of SGLT2 inhibitor compared with sulfonylurea therapy. The inverse probability of the treatment adherence weighting method was used to estimate the per-protocol effect sizes. RESULTS: Among the 128 293 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.60 [9.84] years; 122 096 [95.17%] men), 23 870 received an SGLT2 inhibitor and 104 423 received a sulfonylurea. Compared with sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.87), yielding an event rate difference of −5.15 (95% CI, −7.16 to −3.02) deaths per 1000 person-years. Compared with sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of death, regardless of cardiovascular disease status, in several categories of estimated glomerular filtration rate (including rates from >90 to ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and in participants with no albuminuria (albumin to creatinine ratio [ACR] ≤30 mg/g), microalbuminuria (ACR >30 to ≤300 mg/g), and macroalbuminuria (ACR >300 mg/g). In per-protocol analyses, continued use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of death compared with continued use of sulfonylureas (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.60-0.74; event rate difference, −10.10; 95% CI, −12.97 to −7.24 deaths per 1000 person-years). In additional per-protocol analyses, continued use of SGLT2 inhibitors with metformin was associated with a reduced risk of death compared with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment without metformin (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.97; event rate difference, −7.62; 95% CI, −17.12 to −0.48 deaths per 1000 person-years).

A large body of evidence also supports the hypothesis that this molecule can contribute to immunoregulation of, among other diseases, infection, autoimmune disease and allergy. New data have also come to light to characterize the receptors for CD200 (CD200R) and their potential mechanism(s) of action at the biochemical level, as well as the description of a novel natural antagonist of CD200, lacking the NH(2)-terminal region of the full-length molecule. Significant controversies exist concerning the relative importance of CD200 as a ligand for all reported CD200Rs. Nevertheless, some progress has been made in the identification of the structural constraints determining the interaction between CD200 and CD200R, and this information has in turn proved of use in developing novel small molecule agonists/antagonists of the interaction.

We aimed to establish whether inhibition of these pathways with denosumab or alendronic acid could reduce disease progression in aortic stenosis. METHODS: In a single-center, parallel group, double-blind randomized controlled trial, patients >50 years of age with calcific aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity >2.5 m/s) were randomized 2:1:2:1 to denosumab (60 mg every 6 months), placebo injection, alendronic acid (70 mg once weekly), or placebo capsule. Participants underwent serial assessments with Doppler echocardiography, computed tomography aortic valve calcium scoring, and (18)F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography and computed tomography. The primary end point was the calculated 24-month change in aortic valve calcium score. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients (mean age, 72±8 years; 21% women) with calcific aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity, 3.36 m/s [2.93–3.82 m/s]; aortic valve calcium score, 1152 AU [655–2065 AU]) were randomized and received the allocated trial intervention: denosumab (n=49), alendronic acid (n=51), and placebo (injection n=25, capsule n=25; pooled for analysis). Serum C-terminal telopeptide, a measure of bone turnover, halved from baseline to 6 months with denosumab (0.23 [0.18–0.33 µg/L] to 0.11 µg/L [0.08–0.17 µg/L]) and alendronic acid (0.20 [0.14–0.28 µg/L] to 0.09 µg/L [0.08–0.13 µg/L]) but was unchanged with placebo (0.23 [0.17–0.30 µg/L] to 0.26 µg/L [0.16–0.31 µg/L]). There were no differences in 24-month change in aortic valve calcium score between denosumab and placebo (343 [198–804 AU] versus 354 AU [76–675 AU]; P=0.41) or alendronic acid and placebo (326 [138–813 AU] versus 354 AU [76–675 AU]; P=0.49). Similarly, there were no differences in change in peak aortic jet velocity or (18)F-sodium fluoride aortic valve uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Neither denosumab nor alendronic acid affected progression of aortic valve calcification in patients with calcific aortic stenosis. Alternative pathways and mechanisms need to be explored to identify disease-modifying therapies for the growing population of patients with this potentially fatal condition.

Anticipatory Care Planning (ACP), through earlier identification of healthcare needs, is evidenced to improve quality of life, decrease aggressive interventions, and prolong life. With patient acceptability of growing importance in the design, implementation, and evaluation of healthcare interventions, this study reports on the acceptability of a primary care based ACP intervention on the island of Ireland. METHODS: As part of the evaluation of a feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) testing an ACP intervention for older people at risk of functional decline, intervention participants [n = 34] were interviewed in their homes at 10-week follow-up to determine acceptability. The intervention consisted of home visits by specifically trained registered nurses who assessed participants’ health, discussed their health goals and plans, and devised an anticipatory care plan in collaboration with participants’ GPs and adjunct clinical pharmacist. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview data. The feasibility cRCT involved eight general practitioner (GP) practices as cluster sites, stratified by jurisdiction, four in Northern Ireland (NI) (two intervention, two control), and four in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) (two intervention, two control). Participants were assessed for risk of functional decline. A total of 34 patients received the intervention and 31 received usual care. FINDINGS: Thematic analysis resulted in five main themes: timing of intervention, understanding of ACP, personality & individual differences, loneliness & social isolation, and views on healthcare provision. These map across the Four Factor Model of Acceptability (‘4FMA’), a newly developed conceptual framework comprising four components: intervention factors, personal factors, social support factors, and healthcare provision factors. CONCLUSION: Acceptability of this primary care based ACP intervention was high, with nurses’ home visits, GP anchorage, multidisciplinary working, personalized approach, and active listening regarded as beneficial.

Baseline reactivity was detected against all four strains both at the level of CD4 and CD8 responses and targeting different proteins. CD4 T cell reactivity was mostly directed to HA/NA proteins in influenza B strains, and NP/M1/M2/NS1/NEP proteins in the case of the Influenza A strains. CD8 responses to both influenza A and B viruses preferentially targeted the more conserved core viral proteins. Following vaccination, both CD4 and CD8 responses against the various influenza antigens were increased in day 15 to day 91 post vaccination period, and maintained a Th1 polarized profile.

However, knowledge is scarce about the associations between severe grief reactions after bereavement and physical and mental health problems and the use of health services. Objectives: The present study sought to investigate the prevalence of severe grief reactions and to study the associations of severe grief reactions with mental and physical health and health care utilization. Method: The sample comprised 20,453 adults aged 40 and above (mean age = 57.2 years, SD = 11.3 years, 52.4% female) who participated in the seventh wave of the Tromsø study. Severe grief was assessed with one question asking whether the respondent has experienced the death of a loved one and currently has difficulty accepting the loss, yearns for the deceased, and experiences intense emotional pain related to the loss. Furthermore, participants answered questions about their current physical health, mental health (Hopkins Symptom Checklist – 10), and the use of health services in the past year. Results: Overall, 5.2% of the participants reported severe grief after a loss in childhood, 25.9% after bereavement in adulthood and 4.1% after bereavement in the previous year. Female gender, higher age, living without a partner, non-Norwegian ethnicity, and lower socio-economic status were associated with severe grief. Severe grief reactions were negatively related to self-reported health, predicted positively current levels of depression and anxiety, and were positively associated with the use of health services. Effect sizes were small. Gender differences in the use of health services were observed.

Here we describe PerFECT 2.0, an Italian web-based platform designed to create a network between tertiary centres with an MDT (hubs) and secondary centres (spokes), aiming to facilitate the diagnosis of IPF. METHODS: PerFECT 2.0 went live on 1 November 2016. Spoke centres submit anonymised documentation (HRCT images, pathological samples, clinical data) for a second opinion on the potential diagnosis of IPF from a hub centre. HRCT images are quickly uploaded, with patient-identifying information automatically removed. The hub centre views documentation online (no downloads allowed), makes any further information requests, then returns their second opinion as free text. An e-learning area contains educational material and simulated training clinical cases. Metrics were collected for 2017–2019; a user survey was conducted from 30 June–31 July 2020. RESULTS: Ten hub centres and 137 spoke centres have registered. The requests for a second opinion numbered 251 in 2017, 270 in 2018 and 265 in 2019 (overall mean 19.9 requests per month). The proportion of requests answered was 100.0% (251) in 2017, 100.0% (270) in 2018 and 97.7% (259) in 2019. The mean response time was 15.7 days. In the user survey, of nine hub responders and 19 spoke responders, 78% and 74%, respectively, reported that the platform is easy to use, and 100% and 89%, respectively, would recommend the platform to colleagues. CONCLUSION: The PerFECT 2.0 web-based platform has created a network that enables secondary centres to gain quick and easy access to a second opinion from a tertiary centre with an MDT through online evaluation of anonymised documentation, thereby facilitating and supporting the timely and accurate diagnosis of IPF.

The objective of our study was to determine the effects of a 6-month swimming, land-based stretching, strengthening and breathing exercise intervention in AS patients. METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 29 (14 females, 15 males) patients diagnosed with AS according to the Modified New York Criteria participated in our study. Participants were randomly assigned to an exercise group (ASE) (16 participants) and a control group (ASC) (13 participants). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP); anthropometric measurements; pulmonary function; aerobic capacity; balance; Bath AS Metrology Index; Bath AS Disease Activity Index and the Bath AS Functional Index were assessed. DISCUSSION: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP did not change notably within or between the groups from pre- to post-intervention. The between group analyses of the physical assessments favoured the ASE with observable improvements in chest expansion (p = 0.002), forced expiration volume (p = 0.012), absolute (p = 0.017) and relative (p = 0.003) maximal oxygen consumption, absolute (p = 0.028) and relative (p = 0.001) physical work capacity. Within the ASE, there is statistical evidence of improvements in 11 of the 19 physical variables. Within the ASC, five of the physical variables deteriorated substantially (p between 0.004 and 0.037) and only balance overall stability on the right improved (p = 0.016). The three functional assessments in the ASE improved (p < 0.007) compared with the ASC post-intervention. A 6-month combined exercise programme may improve physical and functional capacity of AS patients. CONCLUSION: A multimodal exercise intervention may be useful in the management of ankylosing spondylitis.

METHODS: BCR repertoire sequencing and whole-exome sequencing were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from 12 DLBCL patients. Subsequently, a typing model was built with cluster analysis, and prognostic indicators between the two groups were compared to verify the typing model. Then, mutation and bioinformatics analyses were conducted to investigate the potential biomarkers of prognostic differences between the two groups. RESULTS: Based on BCR sequencing data, we divided patients into two clusters (cluster 1 and cluster 2); this classification differed from the traditional typing method (GCB and non-GCB), in which cluster 1 included some non-GCB patients. The progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), metastasis and Shannon diversity index of IGH V-J and survival after chemotherapy were significantly different (P < 0.05) between the two clusters, but no statistical significance was found between the GCB and non-GCB groups. The mutation status of 248 genes was significantly different between cluster 1 and cluster 2. Among them, FTSJ3, MAGED2, and ODF3L2 were the specific mutated genes in all patients in cluster 2, and these genes could be considered critical to the different prognoses of the two clusters of DLBCL patients. CONCLUSION: We constructed a new typing model of DLBCL based on BCR repertoire sequencing that can better predict the survival time after chemotherapy.

The sharing economy provides one method to address the imbalance between the demand and supply of health services to the older adult population. With a substantial aging population, China’s practices in the sharing aging industry may set examples for other “getting old before getting rich” countries. OBJECTIVE: There is a gap in both the data and research on China’s aging industry sharing economy. This paper addresses these data and research lacunae by constructing a framework for the application of a sharing model in China’s aging industry, by assessing the current state of the aging industry sharing economy, by setting out the challenges to the sharing aging health care and service economy, and by making recommendations for the development of the aging industry sharing economy. METHODS: This paper constructs a sharing economy framework in the aging industry covering four aspects (people, facilities, capital, and information) to test the current state and future prospects of China’s aging industry sharing economy. RESULTS: In people sharing, we analyzed the sharing of emotional companionship, doctors, nurses, nursing attendants, and domestic helpers. We discussed facility sharing models from the point of land and housing, medical devices, and other items such as pensioner meals and shared medicine bins. We acknowledge that crowdfunding platforms have developed fast in China, but many older adult users faced problems in their operation. Information sharing is a developing field, which can optimize users’ experiences and should help older adults filter out misinformation, but China currently does not have adequate sharing information platforms for older adults. CONCLUSIONS: We identified four major challenges in China’s aging industry sharing economy: poor adaptability to technology for older adults, mediocre quality of shared services, one-size-fits-all and the concept of the useless elderly, and shortage of qualified practitioners. We make recommendations for specific measures by governments, communities, and enterprises to improve the sharing economy in the aging industry.",2021-07-06,"Hu, Yaolin; Wang, Jian; Nicholas, Stephen; Maitland, Elizabeth",J Med Internet Res,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8293162.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8293162/,

We sought to assess the prevalence and socio-demographic associations of obesity nationwide. METHODS: We assessed the prevalence of overall obesity (body mass index ≥28 kg/m(2)) and abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥85/90 cm for women/men) among 2.7 million community-dwelling adults aged 35 to 75 years in the China PEACE Million Persons Project from 2014 to 2018 and quantified the socio-demographic associations of obesity using multivariable mixed models. RESULTS: Age-standardized rates of overall and abdominal obesity were 14.4% (95% CI, 14.3%–14.4%) and 32.7% (32.6%–32.8%) in women and 16.0% (15.9%–16.1%) and 36.6% (36.5%–36.8%) in men. Obesity varied considerably across socio-demographic subgroups. Older women were at higher risk for obesity (eg, adjusted relative risk [95% CI] of women aged 65–75 versus 35–44 years: 1.29 [1.27–1.31] for overall obesity, 1.76 [1.74–1.77] for abdominal obesity) while older men were not. Higher education was associated with lower risk in women (eg, adjusted relative risk [95% CI] of those with college or university education versus below primary school: 0.47 [0.46–0.48] for overall obesity, 0.61 [0.60–0.62] for abdominal obesity) but higher risk in men (1.07 [1.05–1.10], 1.17 [1.16–1.19]). CONCLUSIONS: In China, over 1 in 7 individuals meet criteria for overall obesity, and 1 in 3 for abdominal obesity. Wide variation exists across socio-demographic subgroups.

Directed evolution, which subjects a gene to iterative rounds of mutagenesis, selection and amplification, is useful for protein engineering. In vivo continuous mutagenesis, which continuously diversifies target genes in the host cell, is a promising tool for accelerating directed evolution. However, combining in vivo continuous evolution and YSD is difficult because mutations in the gene encoding the anchor proteins may inhibit the display of target proteins on the cell surface. In this study, we have developed a modified YSD method that utilises SpyTag/SpyCatcher-based in vivo protein ligation. A nanobody fused with a SpyTag of 16 amino acids and an anchor protein fused with a SpyCatcher of 113 amino acids are encoded by separate gene cassettes and then assembled via isopeptide bond formation. This system achieved a high display efficiency of more than 90%, no intercellular protein ligation events, and the enrichment of target cells by cell sorting. These results suggested that our system demonstrates comparable performance with conventional YSD methods; therefore, it can be an appropriate platform to be integrated with in vivo continuous evolution.",2021-05-26,"Kajiwara, Kaho; Aoki, Wataru; Koike, Naoki; Ueda, Mitsuyoshi",Sci Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0392455bfe9912ad88f39f72d0db38eaafd69cce.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8155107.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8155107/,

The adsorption of the proteins myoglobin (MGB), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and thyroglobulin (TGL) at these surfaces was investigated in situ by ellipsometry to assess the importance of six of the most common surface statistical parameters. For BSA adsorption, both protein film thickness and time constant of adsorption were found to scale linearly with Sq s. For TGL, however, the same adsorption characteristics depend linearly on the surface skewness (Ssk), which we attribute to the rather extreme size of this protein. Finally, a mixed behavior is observed for MGB adsorption, showing different linear correlations with Sq and Ssk.

One plausible way of enhancing the therapeutic effect of virotherapy is to enable it with the ability to concurrently engage the infiltrating immune cells to provide additional antitumor mechanisms. Here, we report the construction and evaluation of two novel chimeric molecules (bispecific chimeric engager proteins, BiCEP and trispecific chimeric engager protein, TriCEP) that can engage both natural killer (NK) and T cells with tumor cells for enhanced antitumor activities. METHODS: BiCEP was constructed by linking orthopoxvirus major histocompatibility complex class I-like protein, which can selectively bind to NKG2D with a high affinity to a mutant form of epidermal growth factor (EGF) that can strongly bind to EGF receptor. TriCEP is similarly constructed except that it also contains a modified form of interleukin-2 that can only function as a tethered form. As NKG2D is expressed on both NK and CD8(+) T cells, both of which can thus be engaged by BiCEP and TriCEP. RESULTS: Both BiCEP and TriCEP showed the ability to engage NK and T cells to kill tumor cells in vitro. Coadministration of BiCEP and TriCEP with an oncolytic herpes simplex virus enhanced the overall antitumor effect. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that TriCEP not only engaged NK and T cells to kill tumor cells, it also promotes the infiltration and activation of these important immune cells. CONCLUSIONS: These novel chimeric molecules exploit the ability of the oncolytic virotherapy in altering the tumor microenvironment with increased infiltration of important immune cells such as NK and T cells for cancer immunotherapy. The ability of BiCEP and TriCEP to engage both NK and T cells makes them an ideal choice for arming an oncolytic virotherapy.",2021-07-06,"Ravirala, Divya; Mistretta, Brandon; Gunaratne, Preethi H; Pei, Guangsheng; Zhao, Zhongming; Zhang, Xiaoliu",J Immunother Cancer,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4a097ebd9681d3d1e0d52d866741be760080f6d4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/315ba9d80184edb137d2601b314c2a70bf5c44df.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8261877.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8261877/,

The aim of this study was to analyze the profile of exhaled breath volatile metabolites (BVM) and gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy volunteers after a single ingestion of maltodextrin (placebo) versus chitin-glucan (CG), an insoluble DF previously shown to be fermented into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) by the human microbiota in vitro. Maltodextrin (4.5 g at day 0) or CG (4.5 g at day 2) were added to a standardized breakfast in fasting healthy volunteers (n = 15). BVM were measured using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) throughout the day. A single ingestion of 4.5 g CG did not induce significant gastrointestinal discomfort. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of breath highlighted that 13 MS-fragments (among 408 obtained from ionizations of breath) discriminated CG versus maltodextrin acute intake in the posprandial state. The targeted analysis revealed that CG increased exhaled butyrate and 5 other BVM – including the microbial metabolites 2,3-butanedione and 3-hydroxybutanone – with a peak observed 6 h after CG intake. Correlation analyses with fecal microbiota (Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing) spotlighted Mitsuokella as a potential genus responsible for the presence of butyric acid, triethylamine and 3-hydroxybutanone in the breath. In conclusion, measuring BMV in the breath reveals the microbial signature of the fermentation of DF after a single ingestion. This protocol allows to analyze the time-course of released bioactive metabolites that could be proposed as new biomarkers of DF fermentation, potentially linked to their biological properties.

Several secondary non-invasive respiratory modalities exist but with their merits and demerits. Given the benefits of nasal high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (nHFOV), we tried to examine whether nHFOV could reduce reintubation rates compared to nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) during the post-extubation phase in preterm infants. Stratified randomisation based on gestational age was done for 86 mechanically ventilated preterm infants between 26 and 36(+6) weeks of gestation within 2 weeks of age to receive either nHFOV or NIPPV post-extubation. The main objective was to compare extubation failure within 72 h following extubation and secondarily feed intolerance, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (> grade 3), composite bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)/mortality, composite duration of oxygen supplementation/ventilation support and SpO2/FiO2 ratio. No statistical difference was noted for primary outcome (RR 0.8, 95% CI: 0.23 to 2.78; p = 1.00) and secondary outcomes. However, nHFOV appeared possibly better in respect to feed tolerance rates and pCO2 washout. Conclusion: Extubation failure within 72 h in infants less than 37 weeks of gestation did not differ between the two groups. However, nHFOV seems promising in reducing enteral feeding issues and pCO2 elimination. Larger multicentre studies are required for exploring benefits of nHFOV.

The present study aimed at evaluating hunger-based early feeding for its efficacy in reducing length of hospitalisation. AIMS AND METHODS: This was a parallel arm superiority randomized control trial. Patients with moderate and severe acute pancreatitis were randomised into hunger-based feeding and conventional feeding groups. Patients in hunger-based feeding group commenced feeding once they felt hungry and in conventional feeding group after normalization of biochemical parameters and resolution of symptoms. Patients were followed up till their discharge and were analyzed for length of hospitalisation, fasting duration, feed intolerance, incidence of infective morbidities and invasive procedures. RESULTS: Hunger-based feeding and conventional feeding group included 56 and 54 patients, respectively. Hunger-based feeding led to a decrease in length of hospitalization (6.3 days in hunger-based feeding vs 7.3 days in conventional feeding group, P = 0.041) and fasting duration (1.6 days in hunger-based feeding vs 2.7 days in conventional feeding group, P = 0.001).The incidence of feed intolerance (P = 0.098), infective morbidities and invasive non-surgical procedures were similar in both the groups. CONCLUSION: Hunger-based feeding significantly reduces length of hospitalization and fasting duration in cases of moderate and severe acute pancreatitis without any significant rise in the incidence of complications.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of sepsis, and its occurrence is a poor prognostic sign to septic patients. We analyzed co-differentially expressed genes (co-DEGs) to explore relationships between septic shock and AKI and reveal potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of septic-shock-associated AKI (SSAKI). METHODS: Two gene expression datasets (GSE30718 and GSE57065) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The GSE57065 dataset included 28 septic shock patients and 25 healthy volunteers and blood samples were collected within 0.5, 24 and 48 h after shock. Specimens of GSE30718 were collected from 26 patients with AKI and 11 control patents. AKI-DEGs and septic-shock-DEGs were identified using the two datasets. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed to elucidate molecular mechanisms of DEGs. We also evaluated co-DEGs and corresponding predicted miRNAs involved in septic shock and AKI. RESULTS: We identified 62 DEGs in AKI specimens and 888, 870, and 717 DEGs in septic shock blood samples within 0.5, 24 and 48 h, respectively. The hub genes of EGF and OLFM4 may be involved in AKI and QPCT, CKAP4, PRKCQ, PLAC8, PRC1, BCL9L, ATP11B, KLHL2, LDLRAP1, NDUFAF1, IFIT2, CSF1R, HGF, NRN1, GZMB, and STAT4 may be associated with septic shock. Besides, co-DEGs of VMP1, SLPI, PTX3, TIMP1, OLFM4, LCN2, and S100A9 coupled with corresponding predicted miRNAs, especially miR-29b-3p, miR-152-3p, and miR-223-3p may be regarded as promising targets for the diagnosis and treatment of SSAKI in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Septic shock and AKI are related and VMP1, SLPI, PTX3, TIMP1, OLFM4, LCN2, and S100A9 genes are significantly associated with novel biomarkers involved in the occurrence and development of SSAKI.

This epidemic of “Application Fever” is expensive for applicants, burdensome for programs, and ultimately does not improve overall Match outcomes. In this review, we discuss the phenomenon of Application Fever, with a focus on contributing factors and costs of this behavior. Application Fever has its origins in the early 1990s. At that time, the number of residency applicants began to outpace the number of available positions. Because an applicant who applies to more residency programs has a greater probability of securing a residency position than an otherwise equivalent applicant who applies to fewer, ""overapplication"" became a dominant strategy and residency applicants began to apply to more residency programs each year. This trend was enhanced and enabled by the introduction of the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS). Although Application Fever is a rational decision for applicants, it imposes a substantial evaluative burden on program directors and necessitates the use of convenience screening metrics. We then briefly review potential solutions, including informational strategies, application limits, and marketplace incentives to reduce application numbers. Although a fixed cap on applications would reduce application numbers and facilitate a holistic selection process, greater transparency from residency programs regarding their selection criteria would be required to help applicants choose where to apply. To improve the residency application process for programs and applicants alike, we call upon the medical community to further study Application Fever and carefully consider solutions, including fixed application caps.",2021-03-10,"Carmody, J.

However, the error rate of long-read technologies is higher than that of short-read technologies. This has a direct consequence on the base quality of genome assemblies, particularly in coding regions where sequencing errors can disrupt the coding frame of genes. In the case of diploid genomes, the consensus of a given gene can be a mixture between the two haplotypes and can lead to premature stop codons. Several methods have been developed to polish genome assemblies using short reads and generally, they inspect the nucleotide one by one, and provide a correction for each nucleotide of the input assembly. As a result, these algorithms are not able to properly process diploid genomes and they typically switch from one haplotype to another.

Our hypothesis was that diaphragm dysfunction is not particularly associated with weaning-induced pulmonary oedema. METHODS: It was a single-centre and physiological study conducted in patients who had failed a first spontaneous breathing trial and who underwent a second trial. The diaphragm function was evaluated by measuring the tracheal pressure generated in response to a bilateral magnetic phrenic nerves stimulations. Weaning-induced pulmonary oedema was diagnosed in case of failure of the spontaneous breathing trial if patients exhibited signs of plasma concentration or echocardiographic diagnosis of pulmonary artery occlusion pressure elevation. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were included and 31/53 (58%) failed the spontaneous breathing trial, including 24/31 (77%) patients with weaning-induced pulmonary oedema.

However, this progress is threatened by the wide-scale selection of insecticide-resistant malaria vectors. It is, therefore, important to accelerate the generation of evidence for new classes of LLINs. METHODS: This protocol presents a three-arm superiority, single-blinded, cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of 2 novel dual-active ingredient LLINs on epidemiological and entomological outcomes in Benin, a malaria-endemic area with highly pyrethroid-resistant vector populations. The study arms consist of (i) Royal Guard® LLIN, a net combining a pyrethroid (alpha-cypermethrin) plus an insect growth regulator (pyriproxyfen), which in the adult female is known to disrupt reproduction and egg fertility; (ii) Interceptor G2® LLIN, a net incorporating two adulticides (alpha-cypermethrin and chlorfenapyr) with different modes of action; and (iii) the control arm, Interceptor® LLIN, a pyrethroid (alpha-cypermethrin) only LLIN. In all arms, one net for every 2 people will be distributed to each household. Sixty clusters were identified and randomised 1:1:1 to each study arm. The primary outcome is malaria case incidence measured over 24 months through active case detection in a cohort of 25 children aged 6 months to 10 years, randomly selected from each cluster. Secondary outcomes include 1) malaria infection prevalence (all ages) and prevalence of moderate to severe anaemia in children under 5 years old, measured at 6 and 18 months post-intervention; 2) entomological indices measured every 3 months using human landing catches over 24 months. Insecticide resistance intensity will also be monitored over the study period. DISCUSSION: This study is the second cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of these next-generation LLINs to control malaria transmitted by insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. The results of this study will form part of the WHO evidence-based review to support potential public health recommendations of these nets and shape malaria control strategies of sub-Saharan Africa for the next decade.

These movements are a very important part of the production chain but may also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases through the transfer of infected animals over large distances. Social network analysis (SNA) can be used to characterize cattle trade patterns and to identify highly connected premises that may act as hubs in the movement network, which could be subjected to targeted control measures in order to reduce the transmission of communicable diseases such as bovine tuberculosis (TB). Here, we analyzed data on cattle movement and slaughterhouse surveillance for detection of TB-like lesions (TLL) over the 2016–2018 period in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) in Brazil with the following aims: (i) to characterize cattle trade describing the static full, yearly, and monthly snapshots of the network contact trade, (ii) to identify clusters in the space and contact networks of premises from which animals with TLL originated, and (iii) to evaluate the potential of targeted control actions to decrease TB spread in the cattle population of RS using a stochastic metapopulation disease transmission model that simulated within-farm and between-farm disease spread. We found heterogeneous densities of premises and animals in the study area. The analysis of the contact network revealed a highly connected (~94%) trade network, with strong temporal trends, especially for May and November. The TLL cases were significantly clustered in space and in the contact network, suggesting the potential for both local (e.g., fence-to-fence) and movement-mediated TB transmission. According to the disease spread model, removing the top 7% connected farms based on degree and betweenness could reduce the total number of infected farms over three years by >50%. In conclusion, the characterization of the cattle network suggests that highly connected farms may play a role in TB dissemination, although being close to infected farms was also identified as a risk factor for having animals with TLL. Surveillance and control actions based on degree and betweenness could be useful to break the transmission cycle between premises in RS.",2021-01-22,"Cardenas, Nicolas Cespedes; Pozo, Pilar; Lopes, Francisco Paulo Nunes; Grisi-Filho, José H.

But there are multiple reasons to suspect that visual signalling is more widely employed by animals than previously thought. Because visibility of visual marks depends on the background in which they are seen, species spending most of their time living in dark conditions (e.g., in forests and/or having crepuscular and nocturnal habits) may rely on bright signals to enhance visual display. Here, as a result of experimental manipulations, we present, for the first time ever, evidence supporting the use of a new channel of intraspecific communication by a mammal species, i.e., brown bear Ursus arctos adult males relying on visual marks during mating. Bear reactions to our manipulation suggest that visual signalling could represent a widely overlooked mechanism in mammal communication, which may be more broadly employed than was previously thought.",2021-05-04,"Penteriani, Vincenzo; González-Bernardo, Enrique; Hartasánchez, Alfonso; Ruiz-Villar, Héctor; Morales-González, Ana; Ordiz, Andrés; Bombieri, Giulia; Diaz García, Juan; Cañedo, David; Bettega, Chiara; Delgado, María Del Mar",Sci Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/da2f0e54e79d3f1281f89a2bcf945b8464a0bc81.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8096968.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8096968/,

She was treated unsuccessfully with various antibiotics, and it was very challenging to reach a diagnosis. (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) uptake in bones was evaluated using positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), and disseminated mycobacterial infection was suspected. The interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assays QuantiFERON (QFT) and T-SPOT were used to diagnose tuberculosis infection. On testing, a difference in mitogen response was found between these assays. The response was low for QFT but adequate for T-SPOT, suggesting the presence of anti-IFN-γ antibodies. This difference depended on whether the patient’s plasma (including anti-IFN-γ antibodies) was used within the assay system. Mycobacterium abscessus was isolated from lymph node cultures, and plasma anti-IFN-γ antibodies were confirmed. The patient was diagnosed with disseminated M. abscessus infection with underlying adult-onset immunodeficiency caused by anti-IFN-γ antibodies.

Clean rooms have stringent methods of air-filtration and cleaning to minimize microbial contamination for exoplanetary research and minimize the risk of human pathogens, but they are not sterile. Clean rooms make a selective environment for microorganisms that tolerate such cleaning methods. Previous studies have attempted to characterize the microbial cargo through sequencing and culture-dependent protocols. However, there is not a standardized metagenomic workflow nor analysis pipeline for spaceflight hardware cleanroom samples to identify microbial contamination. Additionally, current identification methods fail to characterize and profile the risk of low-abundance microorganisms. RESULTS: A comprehensive metagenomic framework to characterize microorganisms relevant for planetary protection in multiple cleanroom classifications (from ISO-5 to ISO-8.5) and sample types (surface, filters, and debris collected via vacuum devices) was developed. Fifty-one metagenomic samples from SAF clean rooms were sequenced and analyzed to identify microbes that could potentially survive spaceflight based on their microbial features and whether the microbes expressed any metabolic activity or growth. Additionally, an auxiliary testing was performed to determine the repeatability of our techniques and validate our analyses. We find evidence that JPL clean rooms carry microbes with attributes that may be problematic in space missions for their documented ability to withstand extreme conditions, such as psychrophilia and ability to form biofilms, spore-forming capacity, radiation resistance, and desiccation resistance. Samples from ISO-5 standard had lower microbial diversity than those conforming to ISO-6 or higher filters but still carried a measurable microbial load. CONCLUSIONS: Although the extensive cleaning processes limit the number of microbes capable of withstanding clean room condition, it is important to quantify thresholds and detect organisms that can inform ongoing Planetary Protection goals, provide a biological baseline for assembly facilities, and guide future mission planning.

The animals of the PMV and VILI groups were ventilated with tidal volumes of 6 and 35 ml kg(−1), respectively, for 90 minutes. After the first 60 minutes of ventilation, the animals in the laser groups were irradiated (808 nm, 100 mW power density, 20 J cm(−2) energy density, continuous emission mode, and exposure time of 5 s) and after 30 minutes of irradiation, the animals were euthanized. Lung samples were removed for morphological analysis, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and real time quantitative polynucleotide chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The VILI group showed a greater acute lung injury (ALI) score with an increase in neutrophil infiltration, higher neutrophil count in the BAL fluid and greater cytokine mRNA expression compared to the PMV groups (p < 0.05).

APS is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of thrombosis and antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), which provide a pro-coagulant state. The aPL included in the classification criteria are lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin (aCL) and anti-β2-glycoprotein-I antibodies (aB2GPI) of IgG and IgM isotypes. Extra-criteria aPL, especially IgA aB2GPI and IgG/IgM anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibodies (aPS/PT), have been strongly associated with thrombosis. However, their role in the general population suffering from stroke is unknown. We aim (1) to evaluate the aPL prevalence in ischemic stroke patients, (2) to determine the role of aPL as a risk factor for stroke, and (3) to create an easy-to-use tool to stratify the risk of ischemic stroke occurrence considering the presence of aPL and other risk factors. Materials and Methods: A cohort of 245 consecutive ischemic stroke patients was evaluated in the first 24 h after the acute event for the presence of classic aPL, extra-criteria aPL (IgA aB2GPI, IgG, and IgM aPS/PT) and conventional cardiovascular risk factors. These patients were followed-up for 2-years. A group of 121 healthy volunteers of the same age range and representative of the general population was used as reference population. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research (Reference numbers CEIC-14/354 and CEIC-18/182). Results: The overall aPL prevalence in stroke patients was 28% and IgA aB2GPI were the most prevalent (20%). In the multivariant analysis, the presence of IgA aB2GPI (OR 2.40, 95% CI: 1.03–5.53), dyslipidemia (OR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.01–2.84), arterial hypertension (OR 1.82, 95% CI: 1.03–3.22), atrial fibrillation (OR 4.31, 95% CI: 1.90–9.78), and active smoking (OR 3.47, 95% CI: 1.72–6.99) were identified as independent risk factors for ischemic stroke. A risk stratification tool for stroke was created based on these factors (AUC: 0.75). Conclusions: IgA aB2GPI are an important independent risk factor for ischemic stroke.

Moreover, the assessment of healthcare service potential access and utilization should take into account the care provided by primary and secondary services. Previous studies on the relationship between healthcare spatial accessibility and utilization often used conventional statistical methods without addressing the scale effect and spatial processes. This study investigated the impact of spatial accessibility to primary and secondary healthcare services on length of hospital stay (LOS), and the efficiency of using a geospatial approach to model this relationship. METHODS: This study focused on the ≥ 75-year-old population of the Nord administrative region of France. Inpatient hospital spatial accessibility was computed with the E2SFCA method, and then the LOS was calculated from the French national hospital activity and patient discharge database. Ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial autoregressive (SAR), and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to analyse the relationship between LOS and spatial accessibility to inpatient hospital care and to three primary care service types (general practitioners, physiotherapists, and home-visiting nurses). Each model performance was assessed with measures of goodness of fit. Spatial statistical methods to reduce or eliminate spatial autocorrelation in the residuals were also explored. RESULTS: GWR performed best (highest R(2) and lowest Akaike information criterion). Depending on global model (OLS and SAR), LOS was negatively associated with spatial accessibility to general practitioners and physiotherapists. GWR highlighted local patterns of spatial variation in LOS estimates. The distribution of areas in which LOS was positively or negatively associated with spatial accessibility varied when considering accessibility to general practitioners and physiotherapists. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that spatial regressions could be useful for analysing the relationship between healthcare spatial accessibility and utilization. In our case study, hospitalization of elderly people was shorter in areas with better accessibility to general practitioners and physiotherapists. This may be related to the presence of effective community healthcare services. GWR performed better than LOS and SAR. The identification by GWR of how these relationships vary spatially could bring important information for public healthcare policies, hospital decision-making, and healthcare resource allocation.",2021-05-19,"Gao, Fei; languille, Clara; karzazi, Khalil; Guhl, Mélanie; Boukebous, Baptiste; Deguen, Séverine",Int J Health Geogr,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3492dcfe768e639929de817656e2d50df822dc02.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8136234.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136234/,

The nucleotide-binding and oligomerisation (NOD) domain-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain (PYD)-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a protein complex and a vital component of the immune system. Emerging evidence has indicated that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in cerebrovascular diseases. The function of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases remains an interesting field of research. In this review, we first summarised the pathological mechanism of cerebrovascular diseases and the pathological mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome in aggravating atherosclerosis and cerebrovascular diseases. Second, we outlined signalling pathways through which the NLRP3 inflammasome participates in aggravating or mitigating cerebrovascular diseases. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), ROS/thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and purinergic receptor-7 (P2X7R) signalling pathways can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome; activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can aggravate cerebrovascular diseases by mediating apoptosis and pyroptosis. Autophagy/mitochondrial autophagy, nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), interferon (IFN)-β, sirtuin (SIRT), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) reportedly alleviate cerebrovascular diseases by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

In adults, the classification of septic patients by clinical AKI phenotypes (severity and timing) demonstrates unique associations with patient outcome vs. broadly defined AKI. METHODS: In a multinational prospective observational study, AKI diagnosis in critically ill septic children was stratified by duration (transient vs. persistent) and severity (mild vs. severe by creatinine change and urine output). The outcomes of interest were mortality and intensive care unit resource complexity at 28 days. RESULTS: Seven hundred and fifty-seven septic children were studied (male 52.7%, age 4.6 years (1.5–11.9)). Mortality (overall 12.1%) was different between severe AKI and mild AKI (18.3 vs. 4.4%, p < 0.001) as well as intensive care unit (ICU) complexity (overall 34.5%, 45 vs. 21.7%, p < 0.001). Patients with Persistent AKI had fewer ICU-free days (17 (7, 21) vs. 24 (17, 26), p < 0.001) and higher ICU complexity (52.8 vs. 22.9%, p = 0.002) than transient AKI, even after exclusion of patients with early mortality. AKI phenotypes incorporating temporal and severity data correlate with unique survival (range 4.4–21.6%) and ICU-free days (range of 15–25 days) CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of septic children with AKI changes by clinical phenotype. Our findings underscore the importance of prognostic enrichment in sepsis and AKI for the purpose of trial design and patient management. IMPACT: Although AKI occurs commonly in patients with sepsis (S-AKI), outcomes for children with S-AKI varies based on the severity and timing of the AKI. Existing S-AKI pediatric data utilize a broad singular definition of kidney injury. Increasing the precision of AKI classification results in a new understanding of how S-AKI associates with patient outcome.

Although vaccine skepticism is not new, social media has amplified public concerns and facilitated their spread globally. Multiple studies have been conducted to monitor vaccination discussions on social media. However, there is currently insufficient evidence on the best methods to perform social media monitoring. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the methods most commonly used for monitoring vaccination-related topics on different social media platforms, along with their effectiveness and limitations. METHODS: A systematic scoping review was conducted by applying a comprehensive search strategy to multiple databases in December 2018. The articles’ titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened by two reviewers using inclusion and exclusion criteria. After data extraction, a descriptive analysis was performed to summarize the methods used to monitor and analyze social media, including data extraction tools; ethical considerations; search strategies; periods monitored; geolocalization of content; and sentiments, content, and reach analyses. RESULTS: This review identified 86 articles on social media monitoring of vaccination, most of which were published after 2015. Although 35 out of the 86 studies used manual browser search tools to collect data from social media, this was time-consuming and only allowed for the analysis of small samples compared to social media application program interfaces or automated monitoring tools. Although simple search strategies were considered less precise, only 10 out of the 86 studies used comprehensive lists of keywords (eg, with hashtags or words related to specific events or concerns). Partly due to privacy settings, geolocalization of data was extremely difficult to obtain, limiting the possibility of performing country-specific analyses. Finally, 20 out of the 86 studies performed trend or content analyses, whereas most of the studies (70%, 60/86) analyzed sentiments toward vaccination. Automated sentiment analyses, performed using leverage, supervised machine learning, or automated software, were fast and provided strong and accurate results. Most studies focused on negative (n=33) and positive (n=31) sentiments toward vaccination, and may have failed to capture the nuances and complexity of emotions around vaccination. Finally, 49 out of the 86 studies determined the reach of social media posts by looking at numbers of followers and engagement (eg, retweets, shares, likes). CONCLUSIONS: Social media monitoring still constitutes a new means to research and understand public sentiments around vaccination. A wide range of methods are currently used by researchers.

In total, 540 blood samples were obtained from the participants (388 males and 152 females) and analyzed for serum levels of ALT, AST, GGT, and ALP using standard methods. General obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27.5 kg/m(2) and abdominal obesity was defined as waist circumference (WC) ≥ 90 cm in males and ≥ 80 cm in females. The relationship between liver enzymes and obesity was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression models. Overall, 58% of participants in the general obesity group and 55% of the participants in the abdominal obesity group had at least one or more elevated levels of liver enzymes. The prevalence of elevated liver enzymes was significantly higher in the obesity group compared to the normal BMI and WC groups (p < 0.05 for all cases).

The following strategies were identified efficacious: prompts/cues (SMD=3.29, 95% CI (1.97 to 4.62)), credible source (standardised mean difference, SMD=2.08, 95% CI (0.95;3.22)), adding objects to the environment (SMD=1.47, 95% CI (0.41 to 2.53)), generalisation of the target behaviour SMD=1.32, 95% CI (0.22 to 2.41)), monitoring of behaviour by others without feedback (SMD=1.02, 95% CI (0.05 to 1.98)), self-monitoring of outcome(s) of behaviour (SMD=0.79, 95% CI (0.06 to 1.52), graded tasks (SMD=0.73, 95% CI (0.22 to 1.24)), behavioural practice/rehearsal (SMD=0.72, 95% CI (0.26 to 1.18)), action planning (SMD=0.62, 95% CI (0.03 to 1.21)) and goal setting (behaviour) (SMD=0.56, 95% CI (0.03 to 1.08)). CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests intervention characteristics that may be suitable for promoting physical activity in heart failure. There is moderate evidence in support of an exercise programme combined with a behavioural change intervention delivered by a physiotherapist in a group-based and centre-based settings.

Many chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by a disruption of microbial communities in at least one biological niche/organ system. Various molecular mechanisms between microbial and host components such as proteins, RNAs, metabolites have recently been identified, thus filling many gaps in our understanding of how the microbiome modulates host processes. Concurrently, high-throughput technologies have enabled the profiling of heterogeneous datasets capturing community level changes in the microbiome as well as the host responses. However, due to limitations in parallel sampling and analytical procedures, big gaps still exist in terms of how the microbiome mechanistically influences host functions at a system and community level. In the past decade, computational biology and machine learning methodologies have been developed with the aim of filling the existing gaps. Due to the agnostic nature of the tools, they have been applied in diverse disease contexts to analyze and infer the interactions between the microbiome and host molecular components. Some of these approaches allow the identification and analysis of affected downstream host processes. Most of the tools statistically or mechanistically integrate different types of -omic and meta -omic datasets followed by functional/biological interpretation. In this review, we provide an overview of the landscape of computational approaches for investigating mechanistic interactions between individual microbes/microbiome and the host and the opportunities for basic and clinical research.

Post-surgical nutritional support via enteral administration of ω-3 fatty acids has been seen to be effective although its bad tolerance. There are few clinical trials with parenteral ω-3 fatty acids in these patients. We propose to investigate the effect of combining a parenteral fish oil lipid emulsion with the standard enteral nutrition (EN) support. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blind study in esophagectomized patients, and treated after surgery with parenteral lipid emulsions of ω-3 fatty acids or a mixture of ω-6 long-chain triglycerides/short-chain triglycerides 50%. These emulsions will be added to the standard nutritional support in continuous infusion until 5 days of treatment have been completed. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 in Group A receiving 0.4 g/kg/d of fish-oil lipid emulsion and 0.4 g/kg/d of a lipid emulsion mixture of ω-6 long-chain fatty acids (LCT) plus medium-chain fatty acids (MCT) (total dose of 0.8 g/kg/d of lipid emulsion); Group B receiving 0.8 g/kg/d of fish oil lipid emulsion and Group C receiving 0.8 g/kg/d of LCT/MCT emulsion. The main objective is to determine whether 5 days administration of intravenous ω-3 fatty acid lipid emulsion is effective in normalizing interleukin-6 levels compared with LCT/MCT emulsions, and whether a 0.8 g/kg/d dose is more effective than 0.4 g/kg/d. Secondary outcomes include other inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-10, and parameters of morbidity, safety, nutrition and mortality. Samples will be collected at the time when surgery is indicated and on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 21 to determine inflammatory, nutritional, hepatic and safety parameters. In addition, clinical follow-up will be continued throughout the hospital admision and up to 1 year after surgery. DISCUSSION: Studies of ω-3 fatty acids administered parenterally in esophagectomized patients are scarce. This study proposes to investigate the effect of combining fish-oil lipid emulsions administered parenterally with EN support. Potential benefits include fast incorporation of lipids to the cellular membranes and to the inflammatory cascade, and the use of only 1 pharmaconutrient.

Pms derived from venous return curves during inspiratory holds with incremental airway pressures (Pms-Insp) estimates Pms reliably but is labor-intensive. A computerized algorithm to calculate Pms (Pmsa) at the bedside has been proposed. In previous studies Pmsa and Pms-Insp correlated well but with considerable bias. This observational study was performed to validate Pmsa with Pms-Insp in cardiac surgery patients. Cardiac output, right atrial pressure and mean arterial pressure were prospectively recorded to calculate Pmsa using a bedside monitor. Pms-Insp was calculated offline after performing inspiratory holds. Intraclass-correlation coefficient (ICC) and assessment of agreement were used to compare Pmsa with Pms-Insp. Bias, coefficient of variance (COV), precision and limits of agreement (LOA) were calculated. Proportional bias was assessed with linear regression. A high degree of inter-method reliability was found between Pmsa and Pms-Insp (ICC 0.89; 95%CI 0.72–0.96, p = 0.01) in 18 patients. Pmsa and Pms-Insp differed not significantly (11.9 mmHg, IQR 9.8–13.4 vs. 12.7 mmHg, IQR 10.5–14.4, p = 0.38). Bias was −0.502 ± 1.90 mmHg (p = 0.277). COV was 4% with LOA –4.22 − 3.22 mmHg without proportional bias. Conversion coefficient Pmsa ➔ Pms-Insp was 0.94. This assessment of agreement demonstrates that the measures Pms-Insp and the computerized Pmsa-algorithm are interchangeable (bias −0.502 ± 1.90 mmHg with conversion coefficient 0.94). The choice of Pmsa is straightforward, it is non-interventional and available continuously at the bedside in contrast to Pms-Insp which is interventional and calculated off-line. Further studies should be performed to determine the place of Pmsa in the circulatory management of critically ill patients.

Ultrafiltration for each APD exchange were recorded for 16 days using RPM in 14 patients.

Simulations in a virtual patient showed that lower ultrafiltration (by 114 mL) was related to increased peritoneal tissue hydration caused by inflow of 187 mL of water during the first APD(DD) exchange.

Several advantages, such as cost-effectiveness, ease of design and production, good biocompatibility of plasmid DNA, attractive biosafety, and DNA stability, are found in DNA vaccines. METHODS: In this study, the plasmids expressing bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) gB, gC, and gD proteins were mixed at the same mass ratio and adsorbed polyethyleneimine (PEI) magnetic beads with a diameter of 50 nm. Further, the plasmid and PEI magnetic bead polymers were packaged into double carboxyl polyethylene glycol (PEG) 600 to use as a DNA vaccine. The prepared DNA vaccine was employed to vaccinate mice via the intranasal route. The immune responses were evaluated in mice after vaccination. RESULTS: The expression of viral proteins could be largely detected in the lung and rarely in the spleen of mice subjected to a vaccination. The examination of biochemical indicators, anal temperature, and histology indicated that the DNA vaccine was safe in vivo. However, short-time toxicity was observed. The total antibody detected with ELISA in vaccinated mice showed a higher level than PBS, DNA, PEI + DNA, and PBS groups. The antibody level was significantly elevated at the 15th week and started to decrease since the 17th week. The neutralizing antibody titer was significantly higher in DNA vaccine than naked DNA vaccinated animals. The total IgA level was much greater in the DNA vaccine group compared to other component vaccinated groups. The examination of cellular cytokines and the percentage of CD4/CD8 indicated that the prepared DNA vaccine induced a strong cellular immunity. CONCLUSION: The mixed application of plasmids expressing BoHV-1 gB/gC/gD proteins by nano-carrier through intranasal route could effectively activate long-term humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses at high levels in mice. These data indicate PEI magnetic beads combining with PEG600 are an efficient vector for plasmid DNA to deliver intranasally as a DNA vaccine candidate.

However, data regarding the clinical resolution of loss of smell and/or taste are lacking. In this study we assess smell and taste loss resolution at 4–6 week follow-up, aim to identify risk factors for persistent smell loss and describe smell loss as a feature of long-COVID in a community cohort in London with known SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibody status. We also compare subjective and objective smell assessments in a subset of participants. METHODS: Four hundred sixty-seven participants with acute loss of smell and/or taste who had undergone SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibody testing 4–6 weeks earlier completed a follow-up questionnaire about resolution of their symptoms. A subsample of 50 participants completed an objective olfactory test and results were compared to subjective smell evaluations. RESULTS: People with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with an acute loss of sense of smell and taste were significantly less likely to recover their sense of smell/taste than people who were seronegative (smell recovery: 57.7% vs. 72.1%, p = 0.027. taste recovery 66.2% vs. 80.3%, p = 0.017). In SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, a higher percentage of male participants reported full resolution of smell loss (72.8% vs. 51.4%; p < 0.001) compared to female participants, who were almost 2.5-times more likely to have ongoing smell loss after 4–6 weeks (OR 2.46, 95%CI 1.47–4.13, p = 0.001). Female participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and unresolved smell loss and unresolved taste loss were significantly older (> 40 years) than those who reported full resolution. Participants who experienced parosmia reported lower smell recovery rates and participants with distorted taste perception lower taste recovery rates. Parosmia had a significant association to unresolved smell loss (OR 2.47, 95%CI 1.54–4.00, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although smell and/or taste loss are often transient manifestations of COVID-19, 42% of participants had ongoing loss of smell, 34% loss of taste and 36% loss of smell and taste at 4–6 weeks follow-up, which constitute symptoms of ‘long-COVID’. Females (particularly > 40 years) and people with a distorted perception of their sense of smell/taste are likely to benefit from prioritised early therapeutic interventions.

The International Organization for Standardization and the Medical Device Single Audit Program instituted certifications to ensure that connected devices are compatible and operate within their proper clinical parameters. These efforts came about, in part, as a consequence of clinicians’ decisions to use nonstandard, modified, or improvised devices for purposes outside the original manufacturers’ approved parameters. Unapproved device modifications can be associated with increased risk of dosing errors, monitoring errors, tubing misconnections and serious or potentially fatal adverse events; furthermore, health care providers who implement unapproved device modifications may assume legal and financial liability should harm come to patients as a consequence of the modification. Using the inhaled nitric oxide delivery system as an example, the objective of this paper is to raise awareness of the potential dangers associated with unapproved modification and interfacing of therapeutic gas delivery systems and ventilators in the neonatal intensive care unit setting.

This prodrug is activated and converted to an active form, Pyrazinoic acid (POA), by Pyrazinamidase (PZase) enzyme. Mtb resistance to PZA is the outcome of mutations frequently reported in pncA, rpsA, and panD genes. Among the mentioned genes, pncA mutations contribute to 72–99% of the total resistance to PZA. Thus, considering the vital importance of this gene in PZA resistance, its frequent mutations (D49N, Y64S, W68G, and F94A) were investigated through in-depth computational techniques to put conclusions that might be useful for new scaffolds design or structure optimization to improve the efficacy of the available drugs. Mutants and wild type PZase were used in extensive and long-run molecular dynamics simulations in triplicate to disclose the resistance mechanism induced by the above-mentioned point mutations. Our analysis suggests that these mutations alter the internal dynamics of PZase and hinder the correct orientation of PZA to the enzyme. Consequently, the PZA has a low binding energy score with the mutants compared with the wild type PZase. These mutations were also reported to affect the binding of Fe(2+) ion and its coordinated residues. Conformational dynamics also revealed that β-strand two is flipped, which is significant in Fe(2+) binding. MM-GBSA analysis confirmed that these mutations significantly decreased the binding of PZA. In conclusion, these mutations cause conformation alterations and deformities that lead to PZA resistance.",2021-05-20,"Nangraj, Asma Sindhoo; Khan, Abbas; Umbreen, Shaheena; Sahar, Sana; Arshad, Maryam; Younas, Saba; Ahmad, Sajjad; Ali, Shahid; Ali, Syed Shujait; Ali, Liaqat; Wei, Dong-Qing",Front Mol Biosci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e67d08469b8b766c20fffd2f7b8adf46950a3a05.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8174790.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8174790/,

Beds, overlays or mattresses are widely used with the aim of treating pressure ulcers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of beds, overlays and mattresses on pressure ulcer healing in people with pressure ulcers of any stage, in any setting. SEARCH METHODS: In November 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that allocated participants of any age to pressure‐redistributing beds, overlays or mattresses. Comparators were any beds, overlays or mattresses that were applied for treating pressure ulcers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and the certainty of the evidence assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 studies (972 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 72 participants). The average age of participants ranged from 64.0 to 86.5 years (median: 82.7 years) and all studies recruited people with existing pressure ulcers (the baseline ulcer area size ranging from 4.2 to 18.6 cm(2),median 6.6 cm(2)). Participants were recruited from acute care settings (six studies) and community and long‐term care settings (seven studies). Of the 13 studies, three (224 participants) involved surfaces that were not well described and therefore could not be classified. Additionally, six (46.2%) of the 13 studies presented findings which were considered at high overall risk of bias. We synthesised data for four comparisons in the review: alternating pressure (active) air surfaces versus foam surfaces; reactive air surfaces versus foam surfaces; reactive water surfaces versus foam surfaces, and a comparison between two types of alternating pressure (active) air surfaces. We summarise key findings for these four comparisons below. (1) Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces versus foam surfaces: we are uncertain if there is a difference between alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and foam surfaces in the proportion of participants whose pressure ulcers completely healed (two studies with 132 participants; the reported risk ratio (RR) in one study was 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 3.58). There is also uncertainty for the outcomes of patient comfort (one study with 83 participants) and adverse events (one study with 49 participants). These outcomes have very low‐certainty evidence. Included studies did not report time to complete ulcer healing, health‐related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. (2) Reactive air surfaces versus foam surfaces: it is uncertain if there is a difference in the proportion of participants with completely healed pressure ulcers between reactive air surfaces and foam surfaces (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.80; I(2) = 0%; 2 studies, 156 participants; low‐certainty evidence). When time to complete pressure ulcer healing is considered using a hazard ratio, data from one small study (84 participants) suggests a greater hazard for complete ulcer healing on reactive air surfaces (hazard ratio 2.66, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.17; low‐certainty evidence). These results are sensitive to the choice of outcome measure so should be interpreted as uncertain. We are also uncertain whether there is any difference between these surfaces in patient comfort responses (1 study, 72 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and in adverse events (2 studies, 156 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There is low‐certainty evidence that reactive air surfaces may cost an extra 26 US dollars for every ulcer‐free day in the first year of use (1 study, 87 participants). Included studies did not report health‐related quality of life. (3) Reactive water surfaces versus foam surfaces: it is uncertain if there is a difference between reactive water surfaces and foam surfaces in the proportion of participants with healed pressure ulcers (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.63; 1 study, 101 participants) and in adverse events (1 study, 120 participants). All these have very low‐certainty evidence. Included studies did not report time to complete ulcer healing, patient comfort, health‐related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. (4) Comparison between two types of alternating pressure (active) air surfaces: it is uncertain if there is a difference between Nimbus and Pegasus alternating pressure (active) air surfaces in the proportion of participants with healed pressure ulcers, in patient comfort responses and in adverse events: each of these outcomes had four studies (256 participants) but very low‐certainty evidence. Included studies did not report time to complete ulcer healing, health‐related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain about the relative effects of most different pressure‐redistributing surfaces for pressure ulcer healing (types directly compared are alternating pressure air surfaces versus foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces versus foam surfaces, reactive water surfaces versus foam surfaces, and Nimbus versus Pegasus alternating pressure (active) air surfaces). There is also uncertainty regarding the effects of these different surfaces on the outcomes of comfort and adverse events. However, people using reactive air surfaces may be more likely to have pressure ulcers completely healed than those using foam surfaces over 37.5 days' follow‐up, and reactive air surfaces may cost more for each ulcer‐free day than foam surfaces. Future research in this area could consider the evaluation of alternating pressure air surfaces versus foam surfaces as a high priority. Time‐to‐event outcomes, careful assessment of adverse events and trial‐level cost‐effectiveness evaluation should be considered in future studies. Further review using network meta‐analysis will add to the findings reported here.",2021-05-10,"Shi, Chunhu; Dumville, Jo C; Cullum, Nicky; Rhodes, Sarah; Jammali-Blasi, Asmara; Ramsden, Victoria; McInnes, Elizabeth",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/13ba0445a89cf45f85abfc6cab461157ce471dc7.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8108042.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8108042/,

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and associations of work-related trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among a cohort of resident physicians in their internship year of training. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study involved physicians entering internship at US residency programs nationwide in 2018. Participants completed a baseline survey 1 to 2 months before commencing internship, as well as follow-up surveys at 4 time points during internship. Statistical analysis was performed from April 2020 to January 2021. EXPOSURES: Twelve months of internship. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of work-related trauma and prevalence of PTSD among those who experienced work-related trauma. Trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Primary Care PTSD Screen for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (PC-PTSD-5). Risk factors assessed included depression, anxiety, early family environment, stressful life experiences, medical specialty, hours worked, and concern about medical errors. RESULTS: Among 1134 interns who completed the PC-PTSD-5 at month 12 of internship, 665 (58.6%) were female and 695 (61.6%) were non-Hispanic White; the mean (SD) age was 27.52 (2.50) years. There were 640 interns (56.4%) who reported work-related trauma exposure; among these interns with trauma exposure, 123 (19.0%) screened positive for PTSD. Overall, 123 of 1134 training physicians (10.8%) screened positive for PTSD by the end of internship year, as compared with a 12-month PTSD prevalence rate of 3.6% in the general population. Multivariable logistic regression analyses, adjusting for demographic characteristics, indicated that risk factors associated with trauma exposure included non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity (odds ratio [OR], 1.51 [95% CI, 1.14-2.01]; P = .004), more hours worked (OR, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00-1.03]; P = .03), early family environment (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]; P < .001), and stressful life experiences at baseline (OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.06-2.01]; P = .02). Risk factors associated with PTSD were being unmarried (OR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.07-3.73]; P = .03) and non-Hispanic White (OR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.01-3.11]; P = .05), concern about medical errors (OR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.00-1.46]; P = .05), stressful life experiences during internship (OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.14-1.81]; P = .002), depression at month 12 of internship (OR, 2.52 [95% CI = 1.36-4.65], P = .003), and anxiety at month 12 of internship (OR, 2.14, [95% CI, 1.13-4.04]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that work-related PTSD was 3 times more prevalent among intern physicians than the general population.

Given the ubiquity of mobile phones, their use for health-care coupled with a biometric identification method, present a unique opportunity to address this challenge. Our research proposes an Android-based solution of an ear biometric tool for reliable identification. Unlike many popular biometric approaches (e.g., fingerprints, irises, facial recognition), ears are noninvasive and easily accessible on individuals across a lifespan. Our ear biometric tool uses a combination of hardware and software to identify a person using an image of their ear. The hardware supports an image capturing process that reduces undesired variability. The software uses a pattern recognition algorithm to transform an image of the ear into a unique identifier. We created three cross-sectional datasets of ear images, each increasing in complexity, with the final dataset representing our target use-case population of Zambian infants (N=224, aged 6days-6months). Using these datasets, we conducted a series of validation experiments, which informed iterative improvements to the system.

This limitation can be overcome by leveraging randomly allocated genetic variants in nonlinear Mendelian randomization analyses. Based on their association with blood pressure traits in a genome-wide association study of 299 024 European ancestry individuals, we selected 253 genetic variants to proxy the effect of modifying systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Considering the outcomes of incident coronary artery disease, stroke and the combined outcome of CVD, linear and nonlinear Mendelian randomization analyses were performed on 255 714 European ancestry participants without a history of CVD or antihypertensive medication use. There was no evidence favoring nonlinear relationships of genetically proxied systolic and diastolic blood pressure with the cardiovascular outcomes over linear relationships. For every 10-mm Hg increase in genetically proxied systolic blood pressure, risk of incident CVD increased by 49% (hazard ratio, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.38–1.61]), with similar estimates obtained for coronary artery disease (hazard ratio, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.38–1.63]) and stroke (hazard ratio, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.22–1.70]).

Single doses of 6 mg dexamethasone phosphate (DEX-P), betamethasone phosphate (BET-P), or 1:1 mixture of betamethasone phosphate and acetate (BET-PA) were administered orally (PO) or intramuscularly (IM) where each woman enrolled in a two-period cross-over study. Plasma concentrations collected over 96 h were described with a two-compartment model with differing PO and IM first-order absorption inputs. Overall, BET exhibited slower clearance, similar volume of distribution, faster absorption, and longer persistence than DEX with BET acetate producing extremely slow absorption but full bioavailability of BET. Six biomarkers were assessed over a 24-h baseline period with four showing circadian rhythms with complex baselines. These baselines and the strong responses seen after drug dosing were fitted with various indirect response models using the Laplace estimation methods in NONMEM 7.4. Both the PK and six biomarker responses were well-described with modest variability likely due to the homogeneous ages, weights, and ethnicities of the women. The drugs either inhibited or stimulated the influx processes with some models requiring joint inclusion of drug effects on circadian cortisol suppression. The biomarkers and order of sensitivity (lowest IC(50)/SC(50) to highest) were: cortisol, T-helper cells, basophils, glucose, neutrophils, and T-cytotoxic cells. DEX sensitivities were generally greater than BET with corresponding mean ratios for these biomarkers of 2.86, 1.27, 1.72, 1.27, 2.69, and 1.06. Overall, the longer PK (e.g. half-life) of BET, but lesser PD activity (e.g. higher IC(50)), produces single-dose response profiles that appear quite similar, except for the extended effects from BET-PA.

Sequence-based repertoire analysis has so far offered little evidence for this phenomenon. For example, a recent study estimated the number of shared (‘public’) antibody clonotypes in circulating baseline repertoires to be around 0.02% across ten unrelated individuals. However, to engage the same epitope, antibodies only require a similar binding site structure and the presence of key paratope interactions, which can occur even when their sequences are dissimilar. Here, we search for evidence of geometric similarity/convergence across human antibody repertoires. We first structurally profile naïve (‘baseline’) antibody diversity using snapshots from 41 unrelated individuals, predicting all modellable distinct structures within each repertoire. This analysis uncovers a high (much greater than random) degree of structural commonality. For instance, around 3% of distinct structures are common to the ten most diverse individual samples (‘Public Baseline’ structures). Our approach is the first computational method to find levels of BCR commonality commensurate with epitope immunodominance and could therefore be harnessed to find more genetically distant antibodies with same-epitope complementarity.

Components of this initiative include integrating palliative care into the health care curricula and providing palliative care education to over 400 nurses and other health care professionals within Oman. The four-part education series includes the following courses: (1) Foundations of Palliative Care, (2) Advanced Concepts in Palliative Care, (3) Palliative Care Leadership, and (4) Palliative Care Research. Additional participants from 17 different countries in the Middle East and northern Africa also attended the training. Twenty of the trainees who were considered palliative care leaders in their countries then participated in a Train the Trainer course. This group trained the last cohort of health care professionals in Oman and then took learned concepts and strategies back to their respective countries in order to provide country-wide education and build palliative care capacity in the region.

OBJECTIVE: Aim of the present study was to evaluate potential risk factors for mortality of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. METHODS: A single-center chart review of all patients treated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia over a period of 16 years, at the Medical University of Vienna, was performed. A comparison of medical parameters between survivors and non-survivors, as well as to published literature was conducted. RESULTS: During the observational period 66 patients were diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Overall survival was 84.6%. Left-sided hernia occurred in 51 patients (78.5%) with a mortality of 7.8%. In comparison, right-sided hernia occurred less frequently (n = 12) but showed a higher mortality (33.3%, p = 0.000). Critically instable patients were provided with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 32.3%, n = 21). Survival rate among these patients was 66.7%. Right-sided hernia, treatment with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) over 15 days and the use of ECMO over 10 days were significant risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: The survival rate in this cohort is comparable to the current literature. Parameters such as the side of the diaphragmatic defect, duration of ECMO and inhaled nitric oxide were assessed as mortality risk factors.

However, this growing interest in digital technologies in public health has not been accompanied by a clarity of scope to guide policy, practice, and research in this rapidly emergent field. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review seeks to determine the scope of digital health as described by public health researchers and practitioners and to consolidate a conceptual framework of digital public health. METHODS: The review follows Arksey and O’Malley’s framework for conducting scoping reviews with improvements as suggested by Levac et al. The search strategy will be applied to Embase, Medline, and Google Scholar. A grey literature search will be conducted on intergovernmental agency websites and country-specific websites. Titles and abstracts will be reviewed by independent reviewers, while full-text reviews will be conducted by 2 reviewers to determine eligibility based on prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data will be coded in an iterative approach using the best-fit framework analysis methodology. RESULTS: This research project received funding from the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control Foundation for Population and Public Health on January 1, 2020. The initial search was conducted on June 1, 2020 and returned 6953 articles in total. After deduplication, 4523 abstracts were reviewed, and 227 articles have been included in the review. Ethical approval is not required for this review as it uses publicly available data. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that the findings of the scoping review will contribute relevant evidence to health policy makers and public health practitioners involved in planning, funding, and delivering health services that leverage digital technologies. Results of the review will be strategically disseminated through publications in scientific journals, conferences, and engagement with relevant stakeholders.

How microtubule nucleation and polarity are regulated within neurons remains unclear. We show that γ-tubulin localises asymmetrically to the somatic Golgi within Drosophila neurons. Microtubules originate from the Golgi with an initial growth preference towards the axon. Their growing plus ends also turn towards and into the axon, adding to the plus-end-out microtubule pool. Any plus ends that reach a dendrite, however, do not readily enter, maintaining minus-end-out polarity. Both turning towards the axon and exclusion from dendrites depend on Kinesin-2, a plus-end-associated motor that guides growing plus ends along adjacent microtubules. We propose that Kinesin-2 engages with a polarised microtubule network within the soma to guide growing microtubules towards the axon; while at dendrite entry sites engagement with microtubules of opposite polarity generates a backward stalling force that prevents entry into dendrites and thus maintains minus-end-out polarity within proximal dendrites.",2020-07-13,"Mukherjee, Amrita; Brooks, Paul S; Bernard, Fred; Guichet, Antoine; Conduit, Paul T",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a6d57af0ae2e1c44f6d358aa5c9d9b5996952fd4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7394546.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7394546/,

The objectives of this study are to describe the current pediatric procedural sedation and analgesia practice patterns in European emergency departments, to perform a needs assessment-like analysis, and to identify barriers to implementation. A survey study of European emergency departments treating children was conducted. Through a lead research coordinator identified through the Research in European Pediatric Emergency Medicine (REPEM) network for each of the participating countries, a 30-question questionnaire was sent, targeting senior physicians at each site. Descriptive statistics were performed. One hundred and seventy-one sites participated, treating approximately 5 million children/year and representing 19 countries, with a response rate of 89%. Of the procedural sedation and analgesia medications, midazolam (100%) and ketamine (91%) were available to most children, whereas propofol (67%), nitrous oxide (56%), intranasal fentanyl (47%), and chloral hydrate (42%) were less frequent. Children were sedated by general pediatricians in 82% of cases. Safety and monitoring guidelines were common (74%), but pre-procedural checklists (51%) and capnography (46%) less available. In 37% of the sites, the entire staff performing procedural sedation and analgesia were certified in pediatric advanced life support. Pediatric emergency medicine was a board-certified specialty in 3/19 countries. Physician (73%) and nursing (72%) shortages and lack of physical space (69%) were commonly reported as barriers to procedural sedation and analgesia. Nurse-directed triage protocols were in place in 52% of the sites, mostly for paracetamol (99%) and ibuprofen (91%). Tissue adhesive for laceration repair was available to 91% of children, while topical anesthetics for intravenous catheterization was available to 55%. Access to child life specialists (13%) and hypnosis (12%) was rare. Conclusion: Procedural sedation and analgesia are prevalent in European emergency departments, but some sedation agents and topical anesthetics are not widely available. Guidelines are common but further safety nets, nurse-directed triage analgesia, and nonpharmacologic support to procedural sedation and analgesia are lacking. Barriers to implementation include availability of sedation agents, staff shortage, and lack of space.

The electrospinning method was applied to fabricate the nanofibers, and the prepared wound dressings were thoroughly characterized. RESULTS: SEM imaging showed that the nanofibers were uniform, straight, without any beds with a diameter in the range of 260 to 480 nm. Increasing the concentration of the extract increased the diameter of the nanofibers and also the wettability characteristics while reduced the ultimate tensile strength from 4.37 ± 0.90 MPa for PCL/PVA/Col to 1.62 ± 0.50 MPa for PCL/PVA/Col/Ex 10% (p < 0.05).

The Task Force and content experts provided input on determining thresholds for important effect sizes and on interpretation of findings. RESULTS: Of 41 included studies, 17 and 11 reported on benefits and harms of screening, respectively, and 14 reported on patient preferences. Universal screening for CT in general populations 16 to 29 years of age, using population-based or opportunistic approaches achieving low screening rates, may make little-to-no difference for a female’s risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (2 RCTs, n=141,362; 0.3 more in 1000 [7.6 fewer to 11 more]) or ectopic pregnancy (1 RCT, n=15,459; 0.20 more per 1000 [2.2 fewer to 3.9 more]). It may also not make a difference for CT transmission (3 RCTs, n=41,709; 3 fewer per 1000 [11.5 fewer to 6.9 more]). However, benefits may be achieved for reducing PID if screening rates are increased (2 trials, n=30,652; 5.7 fewer per 1000 [10.8 fewer to 1.1 more]), and for reducing CT and NG transmission when intensely screening high-prevalence female populations (2 trials, n=6127; 34.3 fewer per 1000 [4 to 58 fewer]; NNS 29 [17 to 250]). Evidence on infertility in females from CT screening and on transmission of NG in males and both sexes from screening for CT and NG is very uncertain. No evidence was found for cervicitis, chronic pelvic pain, or infertility in males from CT screening, or on any clinical outcomes from NG screening. Undergoing screening, or having a diagnosis of CT, may cause a small-to-moderate number of people to experience some degree of harm, mainly due to feelings of stigmatization and anxiety about future infertility risk. The number of individuals affected in the entire screening-eligible population is likely smaller. Screening may make little-to-no difference for general anxiety, self-esteem, or relationship break-up. Evidence on transmission from studies comparing home versus clinic screening is very uncertain. Four studies on patient preferences found that although utility values for the different consequences of CT and NG infections are probably quite similar, when considering the duration of the health state experiences, infertility and chronic pelvic pain are probably valued much more than PID, ectopic pregnancy, and cervicitis. How patients weigh the potential benefits versus harms of screening is very uncertain (1 survey, 10 qualitative studies); risks to reproductive health and transmission appear to be more important than the (often transient) psychosocial harms. DISCUSSION: Most of the evidence on screening for CT and/or NG offers low or very low certainty about the benefits and harms. Indirectness from use of comparison groups receiving some screening, incomplete outcome ascertainment, and use of outreach settings was a major contributor to uncertainty. Patient preferences indicate that the potential benefits from screening appear to outweigh the possible harms. Direct evidence about which screening strategies and intervals to use, which age to start and stop screening, and whether screening males in addition to females is necessary to prevent clinical outcomes is scarce, and further research in these areas would be informative. Apart from the evidence in this review, information on factors related to equity, acceptability, implementation, cost/resources, and feasibility will support recommendations made by the Task Force.

However, non-rodent models are required for efficient translational medicine and preclinical studies. Owing to the similarity in the physiological traits of pigs and humans, genetically modified pigs may be a valuable resource for biomedical research. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) using genetically modified somatic cells has been the primary method for the generation of genetically modified pigs. However, site-specific gene modification in porcine cells is inefficient and requires laborious and time-consuming processes. Recent improvements in gene-editing systems, such as zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) system, represent major advances. The efficient introduction of site-specific modifications into cells via gene editors dramatically reduces the effort and time required to generate genetically modified pigs. Furthermore, gene editors enable direct gene modification during embryogenesis, bypassing the SCNT procedure. The application of gene editors has progressively expanded, and a range of strategies is now available for porcine gene engineering. This review provides an overview of approaches for the generation of genetically modified pigs using gene editors, and highlights the current trends, as well as the limitations, of gene editing in pigs.",2021-04-10,"TANIHARA, Fuminori; HIRATA, Maki; OTOI, Takeshige",J Reprod Dev,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c9a97513ccc954927d9d46f2cea4253ccb0d8108.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8238678.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8238678/,

Many factors involved in the neuropathology of AD in DS, including epigenetic factors, innate immunity and impaired haematopoiesis, contribute significantly towards the pathophysiology and the enhanced ageing processes seen in DS and as a consequence of the triplication of genes RUNX1, S100β and OLIG2, together with the influence of proteins that collectively protect from cellular defects and inflammation, which include hepcidin, ferritin, IL-6 and TREM2. This study is aimed at determining whether genetic variants and inflammatory proteins are involved in haematopoiesis and cellular processes in DS compared with age-matched control participants, particularly with respect to neuroinflammation and accelerated ageing. Serum protein levels from DS, AD and control participants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blood smears and post-mortem brain samples from AD and DS subjects were analysed by immunohistochemistry. RUNX1 mRNA expression was analysed by RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation in mouse tissues. Our results suggest that hepcidin, S100β and TREM2 play a critical role in survival and proliferation of glial cells through a common shared pathway. Blood smear analysis showed the presence of RUNX1 in megakaryocytes and platelets, implying participation in myeloid cell development. In contrast, hepcidin was expressed in erythrocytes and in platelets, suggesting a means of possible entry into the brain parenchyma via the choroid plexus (CP). The gene product of RUNX1 and hepcidin both play a critical role in haematopoiesis in DS. We propose that soluble TREM2, S100β and hepcidin can migrate from the periphery via the CP, modulate the blood–brain immune axis in DS and could form an important and hitherto neglected avenue for possible therapeutic interventions to reduce plaque formation.",2021-06-29,"Raha-Chowdhury, Ruma; Raha, Animesh Alexander; Henderson, James; Ghaffari, Seyedeh Deniz; Grigorova, Monika; Beresford-Webb, Jessica; Allinson, Kieren; Chakraborty, Subhojit; Holland, Anthony; Zaman, Shahid H.",J Clin Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d0d78c298d10df39488b388934ee87ba6dafaa12.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8268765.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8268765/,

In Ethiopia, they are the main livestock kept to sustain the livelihoods of pastoralists, as camels are used for milk and meat production and also for transportation. However, she-camel reproductive diseases are one of the major constraints for camel-producing communities. A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2018 to December 2019 to identify and characterize pathological lesions and isolate possible bacteria associated with reproductive diseases and disorders in she-camels slaughtered at Dire Dawa and Babille municipal abattoirs. A total of 155 study animals were examined by recruiting all she-camels slaughtered during every abattoir visit. Overall, 562 reproductive organs, the ovaries, oviducts, uterus, and cervix, were examined through observation, palpation, and incision, and the animal- and organ-level pathological lesion prevalence were found to be 29% and 64.6%, respectively. Degenerative changes, inflammatory lesions (endometritis and salpingitis), growth disturbances (e.g., ovarian hypoplasia), and noninflammatory lesions (e.g., noninflammatory edema) were the identified pathological lesions. Occurrences of pathological changes among reproductive organs had differences where significantly the highest proportion (p = 0.00) was observed in the uteri. Of the 119 microbiological samples processed, 77.3% were positive for single or mixed bacterial genera, from which 7 different bacterial isolates and 14 other unidentified Gram-negative bacteria were detected. E. coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated organisms with 28.2%, 26.9%, and 12.8% frequencies, respectively. The result of the questionnaire survey showed 74% of the respondents had culled the she-camel at productive age because of poor reproductive performance associated with refused mating, abortion, and repeat breeding (poor conception). On the other hand, a majority of camel herders had poor to no information and access to modern veterinary services; nevertheless, they had good indigenous knowledge on how to manage reproductive abnormalities. Considering the importance of camels in our study area, further research on camel reproductive diseases and abnormalities with wider sample and epidemiology need to be conducted using molecular and hormonal assay techniques.",2021-02-13,"Belina, Dinaol; Eshetu, Amare; Alemu, Sisay; Shasho, Bekyad; Mohammed, Tajudin; Mohammed, Ahmedin; Mummed, Bahar; Regassa, Dereje",Vet Med Int,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5784fb1d030850b7bfa9afa82434d10b121056b4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8057907.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8057907/,

We aimed to describe and share our experience using #neoEBM (Neonatal Evidence Based Medicine) hashtag to organise and build a digital community of neonatal care practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of #neoEBM Twitter data in the Symplur Signals database between 1 May 2018 to 9 January 2021. Data on tweets containing the #neoEBM hashtag were analysed using online analytical tools, including the total number of tweets and user engagement. RESULTS: Since its registration, a total of 3 228 distinct individual Twitter users used the hashtag with 23 939 tweets and 37 259 710 impressions generated. The two days with the greatest number of tweets containing #neoEBM were 8 May 2018 (n = 218) and 28 April 2019 (n = 340), coinciding with the annual Pediatric Academic Societies meeting. The majority of Twitter users made one tweet using #neoEBM (n = 1078), followed by two tweets (n = 411) and more than 10 tweets (n = 347). The number of individual impressions (views) of tweets containing #neoEBM was 37 259 710. Of the 23 939 tweets using #neoEBM, 17 817 (74%) were retweeted (shared), 15 643 (65%) included at least one link and 1 196 (5%) had at least one reply. As #neoEBM users increased over time, so did tweets containing #neoEBM, with each additional user of the hashtag associated with a mean increase in 7.8 (95% CI 7.7–8.0) tweets containing #neoEBM. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the observation that the #neoEBM community possesses many of the characteristics of a community of practice, and it may be an effective tool to disseminate research findings. By sharing our experiences, we hope to encourage others to engage with or build online digital communities of practice to share knowledge and build collaborative networks across disciplines, institutions and countries.",2021-05-28,"Keir, Amy; Bamat, Nicolas; Hennebry, Bron; King, Brian; Patel, Ravi; Wright, Clyde; Scrivens, Alexandra; ElKhateeb, Omar; Mitra, Souvik; Roland, Damian",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/fbd4c611e7d15a835c03747378cdeb77584adf6e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8162580.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8162580/,

Little is known about this topic in Greece, which, although a traditionally conservative country, is changing at the legal level towards a greater recognition of transgender people’s rights. This study aimed to investigate transgender people’s attitudes towards having a child to whom they are genetically related and pursuing fertility treatments in Greece. METHODS: This is a prospective qualitative study conducted with adult individuals who identified as transgender men or transgender women between April 2019 and March 2020. Individual in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 participants. The interviews were carried out in person and were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. We performed a thematic analysis of the data. RESULTS: The thematic data analysis resulted in the identification of themes that represent key barriers to pursuing fertility preservation or the use of assisted reproductive technology. Six major themes were clearly present in the findings (lack of adequate information and counseling, worsening gender dysphoria, increased discrimination against transgender people due to the rise of extreme far-right populism, low parental self-efficacy, high costs, and a less-than-perfect legal framework). Moreover, diverse cases were examined, and minor themes, such as the symbolic value of the uterus and pregnancy, the relationship between the type of gender transition and willingness to pursue fertility treatments, and transgender people’s adherence to heteronormative patterns in the context of reproduction, were identified. Various reasons for transgender people’s differing degrees of desire for parenthood were identified. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated contextual factors as well as factors related to transgender people themselves as barriers to pursuing transgender parenthood. Most aspects of our findings are consistent with those of previous research. However, some aspects of our findings (regarding aggressive behaviors and economic instability) are specific to the context of Greece, which is characterized by the rise of extreme far-right populism due to the decade-long Greek economic crisis and a deeply conservative traditionalist background. In that regard, the participants highlighted the (perceived as) less-than-perfect Greek legislation on transgender people’s rights as a barrier to transgender (biological) parenthood.

The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a diuretic strategy to overcome positive fluid balance in patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Design: Multicenter, single-blind, randomized-controlled study. Patients were randomized into a diuretic (furosemide) or a control group. Patients were eligible in case of fluid overload defined as in-ICU weight increase ≥ 3%, invasive mechanical ventilation (FiO(2) ≤ 60% and PEEP ≤ 10 cm H(2)O on inclusion) and hemodynamic stabilization. The primary outcome was fluid balance, defined as weight variation from reference weight to successful extubation. The main secondary outcome was the safety of diuretic. RESULTS: 171 patients were randomized. After 5 exclusions, 166 patients were included in the analysis: 77 in the diuretic and 89 in the control group. Fluid balance was 1.4 [− 2.5 to 4.5] kg in the diuretic and 6.4 [0.5–11.2] kg in the control group (p < 0.001). In the multiple imputation analysis, fluid balance was significantly decreased in the diuretic group (mean difference = − 4.8 95% CI [− 7.3 to − 2.5], p < 0.001). Eleven (14%) patients died in the diuretic group and 16 (18%) patients in the control group (p = 0.5). There was a worsening of Acute Kidney Injury in 67 (75.3%) patients of the control group versus 46 (59.7%) patients in the diuretic group (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter randomized-controlled study, protocolized diuretic therapy reduced fluid accumulation in patients receiving mechanical ventilation and was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and tolerability of high-dose (>12 mg) buprenorphine induction for patients with OUD presenting to an ED. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this case series of ED encounters, data were manually abstracted from electronic health records for all ED patients with OUD treated with buprenorphine at a single, urban, safety-net hospital in Oakland, California, for the calendar year 2018. Data analysis was performed from April 2020 to March 2021. INTERVENTIONS: ED physicians and advanced practice practitioners were trained on a high-dose sublingual buprenorphine induction protocol, which was then clinically implemented. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vital signs; use of supplemental oxygen; the presence of precipitated withdrawal, sedation, and respiratory depression; adverse events; length of stay; and hospitalization during and 24 hours after the ED visit were reported according to total sublingual buprenorphine dose (range, 2 to >28 mg). RESULTS: Among a total of 391 unique patients (median [interquartile range] age, 36 [29-48] years), representing 579 encounters, 267 (68.3%) were male and 170 were (43.5%) Black.

Previous literature reports significant improvement in IBS symptoms with initiation of a low FODMAP diet (LFD) and monitored reintroduction. However, dietary adherence to the LFD is difficult, with patients stating that the information given by health care providers is often generalized and nonspecific, requiring them to search for supplementary information to fit their needs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine whether Heali, a novel artificial intelligence dietary mobile app can improve adherence to the LFD, IBS symptom severity, and quality of life outcomes in adults with IBS or IBS-like symptoms over a 4-week period. METHODS: Participants were randomized into 2 groups: the control group (CON), in which participants received educational materials, and the experimental group (APP), in which participants received access to the mobile app and educational materials. Over the course of this unblinded online trial, all participants completed a battery of 5 questionnaires at baseline and at the end of the trial to document IBS symptoms, quality of life, LFD knowledge, and LFD adherence. RESULTS: We enrolled 58 participants in the study (29 in each group), and 25 participants completed the study in its entirety (11 and 14 for the CON and APP groups, respectively). Final, per-protocol analyses showed greater improvement in quality of life score for the APP group compared to the CON group (31.1 and 11.8, respectively; P=.04). Reduction in total IBS symptom severity score was 24% greater for the APP group versus the CON group. Although this did not achieve significance (–170 vs –138 respectively; P=.37), the reduction in the subscore for bowel habit dissatisfaction was 2-fold greater for the APP group than for the CON group (P=.05). CONCLUSIONS: This initial study provides preliminary evidence that Heali may provide therapeutic benefit to its users, specifically improvements in quality of life and bowel habits. Although this study was underpowered, findings from this study warrant further research in a larger sample of participants to test the efficacy of Heali app use to improve outcomes for patients with IBS.

To explore this molecularly, we investigated the Stx receptor content and transcriptomic profile of two human renal epithelial cell lines: highly Stx-sensitive ACHN cells and largely Stx-insensitive Caki-2 cells. Though both lines exhibited the Stx receptor globotriaosylceramide, RNAseq revealed strikingly different transcriptomic responses to an Stx challenge. Using RNAi to silence factors involved in ACHN cells’ Stx response, the greatest protection occurred when silencing RAB5A and TRAPPC6B, two host factors that we newly link to Stx trafficking.

Individual case management and public health efforts to mitigate the spread of influenza are both strongly impacted by our ability to accurately and efficiently detect influenza viruses in clinical samples. Therefore, it is important to understand the performance characteristics of available assays to detect influenza in a variety of settings. We provide the first report of relative performance between two products marketed to streamline detection of influenza virus in the context of a highly controlled volunteer influenza challenge study. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected during a controlled A/California/2009/H1N1 influenza challenge study and analyzed for detection of virus shedding using a validated qRT-PCR (qPCR) assay, a sample-to-answer qRT-PCR device (BioMerieux BioFire FilmArray RP), and an immunoassay based rapid test kit (Quidel QuickVue Influenza A + B Test). RESULTS: Relative to qPCR, the sensitivity and specificity of the BioFire assay was 72.1% [63.7–79.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI)] and 93.5% (89.3–96.4%, 95% CI) respectively.

RESULTS: Five putative GR binding sites and other transcriptional factor binding sites were identified on theIL-6 promoter, and dexamethasone (DEX) was noted to reduce the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-6 production. Among mutant transcriptional factor binding sites, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), activator protein (AP)-1, and specificity protein (Sp)1–2 sites reduced basal and LPS-induced IL-6 promoter activities through various responses.

Although the disease is known to represent a significant public health problem among these populations, little epidemiological data exists on the subject. This study aims to provide information on malaria incidence, geospatial clustering, and risk factors associated to Plasmodium falciparum infection among these groups. METHODS: This is a descriptive study based on the analysis of published and unpublished programmatic data collected by Venezuelan health authorities and non-government organizations between 2014 and 2018. The Annual Parasite Index among indigenous groups (API-i) in municipalities of three states (Amazonas, Bolivar, and Sucre) were calculated and compared using the Kruskal Wallis test, risk factors for Plasmodium falciparum infection were identified via binomial logistic regression and maps were constructed to identify clusters of malaria cases among indigenous patients via Moran’s I and Getis-Ord’s hot spot analysis. RESULTS: 116,097 cases of malaria in Amerindian groups were registered during the study period. An increasing trend was observed between 2014 and 2016 but reverted in 2018. Malaria incidence remains higher than in 2014 and hot spots were identified in the three states, although more importantly in the south of Bolivar. Most cases (73.3%) were caused by Plasmodium vivax, but the Hoti, Yanomami, and Eñepa indigenous groups presented higher odds for infection with Plasmodium falciparum. CONCLUSION: Malaria cases among Amerindian populations increased between 2014 and 2018 and seem to have a different geographic distribution than those among the general population. These findings suggest that tailored interventions will be necessary to curb the impact of malaria transmission in these groups.

This is ascribed to the advantages offered by the use of MSCs isolated from hPPT over other MSC sources. A paradigm shift in related research is evident that focuses on the secretome of the human MSCs (hMSCs), as therapeutic effects of hMSCs are attributed more so to their secreted growth factors, cytokines and chemokines and to the extracellular vesicles (EVs), all of which are components of the hMSC secretome. Positive therapeutic effects of the hPPT-MSC secretome have been demonstrated in diseases related to skin, kidney, heart, nervous system, cartilage and bones, that have aided fast recovery by replacing damaged, non-functional tissues, via differentiating and regenerating cells. Although certain limitations such as short half -life of the secretome components and irregular secreting patterns exist in secretome therapy, these issues are successfully addressed with the use of cutting-edge technologies such as genome editing and recombinant cytokine treatment. If the current limitations can be successfully overcome, the hPPT-MSC secretome including its EVs may be developed into a cost-effective therapeutic agent amenable to be used against a wide range of diseases/disorders.",2020-12-03,"Udalamaththa, Vindya Lankika; Kaluarachchi, Athula; Wijeratne, Sumedha; Udagama, Preethi Vidya",Indian J Med Res,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8224162.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8224162/,

Adjunctive host-directed therapies could protect the lungs, improve long-term survival, and shorten treatment duration; however, few have been tested clinically. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of four host-directed therapies for tuberculosis. METHODS: In this prospective, open-label, phase 2, randomised controlled trial, patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were recruited at three clinical sites in South Africa. Eligible patients were aged 18–65 years, HIV-1-negative, and had rifampicin-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a sputum Xpert cycle threshold of less than 20, and moderately advanced or far advanced disease on chest radiography. By use of numbers generated in blocks of ten and stratification by site, eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive one of the four oral host-directed treatments plus standard tuberculosis treatment or standard treatment alone (the control group). Host-directed treatments were: CC-11050 (200 mg twice daily, taken with food; day 1–112); everolimus (0·5 mg/day; day 1–112); auranofin (3 mg/day for seven doses, then 6 mg/day; day 1–112); and ergocalciferol (5 mg on day 1, then 2·5 mg on day 28 and day 56). All study participants received oral rifabutin-substituted standard tuberculosis treatment for 180 days. Patients and clinicians were not masked to treatment assignment. Spirometry and sputum culture with solid and liquid media were done at baseline and up to 180 days at specified intervals throughout treatment. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability up to day 210. Secondary preliminary efficacy endpoints were treatment effects on sputum microbiology (culture status at day 56 and the hazard ratio for stable culture conversion up to day 180) and lung function (FEV(1) and forced vital capacity [FVC]) measured by spirometry at day 56, day 180, and day 540. Safety was analysed in the intention-to-treat population and preliminary efficacy primarily in the per-protocol population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02968927. Post-treatment follow-up was completed in 2020. FINDINGS: Between Nov 18, 2016, and Sept 27, 2018, 200 patients were screened and randomly assigned to different treatment groups (n=40 per group, apart from n=39 in the everolimus group after one patient withdrew consent). 11 treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred either during treatment or within 30 days after treatment discontinuation, of which three were attributable to a host-directed treatment. Life-threatening thrombocytopenia occurred in an auranofin recipient; apparent intra-abdominal sepsis leading to death occurred in another auranofin recipient and was classified as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction. Tuberculous spondylitis occurred as an apparent paradoxical reaction in a patient receiving ergocalciferol. Two patients in the control group had life-threatening, treatment-attributable liver injury. No treatment-emergent, treatment-attributable serious adverse events occurred in patients receiving CC-11050 or everolimus. Mean FEV(1) in the control group was 61·7% of predicted (95% CI 56·3–67·1) at baseline and 69·1% (62·3–75·8) at day 180. Patients treated with CC-11050 and everolimus had increased recovery of FEV(1) at day 180 relative to the control group (mean difference from control group 6·30%, 95% CI 0·06–12·54; p=0·048; and 6·56%, 0·18–12·95; p=0·044, respectively), whereas auranofin and ergocalciferol recipients did not. None of the treatments had an effect on FVC during 180 days of follow-up or on measures of sputum culture status over the course of the study. INTERPRETATION: CC-11050 and everolimus were safe and reasonably well tolerated as adjunctive therapies for tuberculosis, and analysis of preliminary efficacy suggests they might also enhance the recovery of FEV(1), a key measure of lung function and predictor of all-cause mortality. Further studies of these candidates are warranted.

Foam surfaces (beds, mattresses or overlays) are widely used with the aim of preventing pressure ulcers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of foam beds, mattresses or overlays compared with any support surface on the incidence of pressure ulcers in any population in any setting. SEARCH METHODS: In November 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that allocated participants of any age to foam beds, mattresses or overlays. Comparators were any beds, mattresses or overlays. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and the certainty of the evidence assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology. If a foam surface was compared with surfaces that were not clearly specified, then the included study was recorded and described but not considered further in any data analyses. MAIN RESULTS: We included 29 studies (9566 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 101 participants). The average age of participants ranged from 47.0 to 85.3 years (median: 76.0 years). Participants were mainly from acute care settings. We analysed data for seven comparisons in the review: foam surfaces compared with: (1) alternating pressure air surfaces, (2) reactive air surfaces, (3) reactive fibre surfaces, (4) reactive gel surfaces, (5) reactive foam and gel surfaces, (6) reactive water surfaces, and (7) another type of foam surface. Of the 29 included studies, 17 (58.6%) presented findings which were considered at high overall risk of bias. Primary outcome: pressure ulcer incidence Low‐certainty evidence suggests that foam surfaces may increase the risk of developing new pressure ulcers compared with (1) alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 2.95; I(2) = 63%; 4 studies, 2247 participants), and (2) reactive air surfaces (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.04 to 5.54; I(2) = 25%; 4 studies, 229 participants). We are uncertain regarding the difference in pressure ulcer incidence in people treated with foam surfaces and the following surfaces: (1) reactive fibre surfaces (1 study, 68 participants); (2) reactive gel surfaces (1 study, 135 participants); (3) reactive gel and foam surfaces (1 study, 91 participants); and (4) another type of foam surface (6 studies, 733 participants). These had very low‐certainty evidence. Included studies have data on time to pressure ulcer development for two comparisons. When time to ulcer development is considered using hazard ratios, the difference in the risk of having new pressure ulcers, over 90 days' follow‐up, between foam surfaces and alternating pressure air surfaces is uncertain (2 studies, 2105 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Two further studies comparing different types of foam surfaces also reported time‐to‐event data, suggesting that viscoelastic foam surfaces with a density of 40 to 60 kg/m(3) may decrease the risk of having new pressure ulcers over 11.5 days' follow‐up compared with foam surfaces with a density of 33 kg/m(3) (1 study, 62 participants); and solid foam surfaces may decrease the risk of having new pressure ulcers over one month's follow‐up compared with convoluted foam surfaces (1 study, 84 participants). Both had low‐certainty evidence. There was no analysable data for the comparison of foam surfaces with reactive water surfaces (one study with 117 participants). Secondary outcomes Support‐surface‐associated patient comfort: the review contains data for three comparisons for this outcome. It is uncertain if there is a difference in patient comfort measure between foam surfaces and alternating pressure air surfaces (1 study, 76 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); foam surfaces and reactive air surfaces (1 study, 72 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and different types of foam surfaces (4 studies, 669 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). All reported adverse events: the review contains data for two comparisons for this outcome. We are uncertain about differences in adverse effects between foam surfaces and alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (3 studies, 2181 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and between foam surfaces and reactive air surfaces (1 study, 72 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Health‐related quality of life: only one study reported data on this outcome. It is uncertain if there is a difference (low‐certainty evidence) between foam surfaces and alternating pressure (active) air surfaces in health‐related quality of life measured with two different questionnaires, the EQ‐5D‐5L (267 participants) and the PU‐QoL‐UI (233 participants). Cost‐effectiveness: one study reported trial‐based cost‐effectiveness evaluations. Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are probably more cost‐effective than foam surfaces in preventing pressure ulcer incidence (2029 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests uncertainty about the differences in pressure ulcer incidence, patient comfort, adverse events and health‐related quality of life between using foam surfaces and other surfaces (reactive fibre surfaces, reactive gel surfaces, reactive foam and gel surfaces, or reactive water surfaces). Foam surfaces may increase pressure ulcer incidence compared with alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and reactive air surfaces. Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are probably more cost‐effective than foam surfaces in preventing new pressure ulcers. Future research in this area should consider evaluation of the most important support surfaces from the perspective of decision‐makers. Time‐to‐event outcomes, careful assessment of adverse events and trial‐level cost‐effectiveness evaluation should be considered in future studies. Trials should be designed to minimise the risk of detection bias; for example, by using digital photography and by blinding adjudicators of the photographs to group allocation. Further review using network meta‐analysis will add to the findings reported here.",2021-05-06,"Shi, Chunhu; Dumville, Jo C; Cullum, Nicky; Rhodes, Sarah; McInnes, Elizabeth",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/786707800ab6be5919f2af13a8705d138cc9df85.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8179968.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8179968/,

The Institute of Medicine recommends integrated care for alcohol use treatment and HIV, but implementation of integrated services remains a challenge in South Africa. This protocol describes a study designed to evaluate trainer, provider-, and patient encounter-level outcomes relating to the national rollout of a cascade train-the-trainer model of task-sharing to build capacity of the HIV workforce to deliver Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) to address risky alcohol use. METHODS: This 5 year protocol consists of two phases. First, we will finalize development of a robust SBIRT train-the-trainer model, which will include an SBIRT Trainer Manual, Provider Resource Guide, fidelity observational coding system, case vignettes, and a curriculum for ongoing consultation sessions. Materials will be designed to build the capacity of novice trainers to train lay workers to deliver SBIRT with fidelity. Second, we will recruit 24–36 trainers and 900 providers in order to evaluate the effects of the SBIRT train-the-trainer model on trainer- (e.g., fidelity, knowledge), provider- (e.g., SBIRT attitudes, confidence, acceptability), and patient encounter- (e.g., proportion receiving screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment) level variables. Data on patient encounters will be tracked by providers on programmed tablets or scannable paper forms in real-time. Providers will report on SBIRT delivery on an ongoing basis over a 6-months period. Additionally, we will test the hypothesis that trainer-level factors will account for a substantial proportion of variability in provider-level factors which will, in turn, account for a substantial proportion of variability in patient encounter-level outcomes. DISCUSSION: This protocol will allow us to take advantage of a unique national training initiative to gather comprehensive data on multi-level factors associated with the implementation of SBIRT in HIV service settings. In the long-term, this research can help to advance the implementation of integrated alcohol-HIV services, providing lessons that can extend to other low-and-middle income countries confronting dual epidemics.",2021-04-30,"Kuo, Caroline C.; Sibeko, Goodman; Akande, Morayo; Allie, Shaheema; Tisaker, Nurain; Stein, Dan J.; Becker, Sara J.",Addict Sci Clin Pract,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3266c8f9a049fedab9f6396fed6a71234a85358c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8085637.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8085637/,

However, the integration of eHealth into regular health care is challenging. It requires organizations to change the way they work and their structure and care processes to be adapted to ensure that eHealth supports the attainment of the desired outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to investigate whether there are identifiable indicators in the structure, process, and outcome categories that are related to the successful integration of eHealth in regular health care, as well as to investigate which indicators of structure and process are related to outcome indicators. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using the Donabedian Structure-Process-Outcome (SPO) framework to identify indicators that are related to the integration of eHealth into health care organizations. Data extraction sheets were designed to provide an overview of the study characteristics, eHealth characteristics, and indicators. The extracted indicators were organized into themes and subthemes of the structure, process, and outcome categories. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included, covering a variety of study designs, diseases, and eHealth tools. All studies identified structure, process, and outcome indicators that were potentially related to the integration of eHealth. The number of indicators found in the structure, process, and outcome categories was 175, 84, and 88, respectively. The themes with the most-noted indicators and their mutual interaction were inner setting (51 indicators, 16 interactions), care receiver (40 indicators, 11 interactions), and technology (38 indicators, 12 interactions)—all within the structure category; health care actions (38 indicators, 15 interactions) within the process category; and efficiency (30 indicators, 15 interactions) within the outcome category. In-depth examination identified four most-reported indicators, namely “deployment of human resources” (n=11), in the inner setting theme within the structure category; “ease of use” (n=16) and “technical issue” (n=10), both in the technology theme within the structure category; and “health logistics” (n=26), in the efficiency theme within the outcome category. CONCLUSIONS: Three principles are important for the successful integration of eHealth into health care. First, the role of the care receiver needs to be incorporated into the organizational structure and daily care process. Second, the technology must be well attuned to the organizational structure and daily care process. Third, the deployment of human resources to the daily care processes needs to be aligned with the desired end results.

On the other hand, in recent years, an imbalance in the composition of the intestinal bacterial population has been linked as another possible trigger for this disease. Given that changes in the gut microbiota have been observed to stimulate the kinurenine pathway, reducing circulating melatonin levels, in this review, we summarize the relationship between circadian disruption and breast cancer, as well as the connection with dysbiosis as possible causing this pathology due to a series of changes that lead to an increase in circulating estrogen levels. ABSTRACT: In this review we summarize a possible connection between gut microbiota, melatonin production, and breast cancer. An imbalance in gut bacterial population composition (dysbiosis), or changes in the production of melatonin (circadian disruption) alters estrogen levels. On the one hand, this may be due to the bacterial composition of estrobolome, since bacteria with β-glucuronidase activity favour estrogens in a deconjugated state, which may ultimately lead to pathologies, including breast cancer. On the other hand, it has been shown that these changes in intestinal microbiota stimulate the kynurenine pathway, moving tryptophan away from the melatonergic pathway, thereby reducing circulating melatonin levels. Due to the fact that melatonin has antiestrogenic properties, it affects active and inactive estrogen levels. These changes increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Additionally, melatonin stimulates the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes, which have low estrogen levels due to the fact that adipocytes do not express aromatase. Consequently, melatonin also reduces the risk of breast cancer. However, more studies are needed to determine the relationship between microbiota, melatonin, and breast cancer, in addition to clinical trials to confirm the sensitizing effects of melatonin to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and its ability to ameliorate or prevent the side effects of these therapies.",2021-06-23,"Laborda-Illanes, Aurora; Sánchez-Alcoholado, Lidia; Boutriq, Soukaina; Plaza-Andrades, Isaac; Peralta-Linero, Jesús; Alba, Emilio; González-González, Alicia; Queipo-Ortuño, María Isabel",Cancers (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2ce61542baea3be6db6f0449719a17a839572f83.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8269379.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8269379/,

We are documenting socio-demographic, health-related, and psychological variables as well as usage behavior data of the programs. According to our sample size calculation, we have to enroll 1114 participants in each Losing and Maintaining Weight and Increasing Fitness RCT and 339 participants in the Smoking Cessation RCT. Additionally, 15–20 participants in the interactive smoking-cessation program will be invited to qualitative telephone interviews with the aim to obtain detailed information concerning utilization, compliance, and satisfaction. The online RCTs’ inclusion criteria are: adults of each gender regardless of whether they are insured with Techniker health insurance fund. Persons with impairments or pre-existing conditions require a medical assessment as to whether the program is suitable for them. Specific exclusion criteria apply to each program/RCT. DISCUSSION: We assume that study participants will improve their health behavior by using the offered online health programs and that each health goal’s intervention group will reveal advantages regarding the outcome variables compared to the control groups.

Levosimendan is an effective inotropic agent used to maintain cardiac output, but its usage is limited by the lack of evidence in patients with severely abnormal renal function. Therefore, we analyzed data of patients with acute heart failure with and without abnormal renal function to examine the effects of levosimendan. METHODS: We performed this retrospective cohort study using data from the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD) of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). Patients admitted for heart failure with LVEF ≤ 40% between January 2013 and December 2018 who received levosimendan or dobutamine in the critical cardiac care units (CCU) were identified. Patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were excluded. Outcomes of interest were mortality at 30, 90, and 180 days after the cohort entry date. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mortality rate at 30, 90, and 180 days after the cohort entry date between the levosimendan and dobutamine groups, or between subgroups of patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or on dialysis. The results were consistent before and after propensity score matching. CONCLUSIONS: Levosimendan did not increase short- or long-term mortality rates in critical patients with acute heart failure and reduced ejection fraction compared to dobutamine, regardless of their renal function. An eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was not necessarily considered a contraindication for levosimendan in these patients.",2021-02-08,"Chan, Cze-Ci; Lee, Kuang-Tso; Ho, Wan-Jing; Chan, Yi-Hsin; Chu, Pao-Hsien",Ann Intensive Care,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7f992bd3041b8f58d29136e66f73927ae94486ff.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7869075.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869075/,

In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director General announced his commitment to eliminate cervical cancer, with HPV vaccination as a priority. However, the costs of setting up a multi-dose HPV vaccination programme remain a barrier to its introduction. METHODS/DESIGN: We are conducting a randomised-controlled trial of reduced dose schedules of HPV vaccine in Tanzania to establish whether a single dose produces immune responses that will be effective in preventing cervical cancer. 930 girls aged 9–14 years in Mwanza, Tanzania, were randomised to one of 6 arms, comprising 3 different dose schedules of the 2-valent (Cervarix) and 9-valent (Gardasil-9) HPV vaccines: 3 doses; 2 doses given 6 months apart; or a single dose. All participants will be followed for 36 months; those in the 1 and 2 dose arms will be followed for 60 months. Trial outcomes focus on vaccine immune responses including HPV 16/18-specific antibody levels, antibody avidity, and memory B cell responses. Results will be immunobridged to historical cohorts of girls and young women in whom efficacy has been demonstrated. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomised trial of the single dose HPV vaccine schedule in the target age group.

The disparities in breastfeeding support across Chicagoland are symptomatic of inequitable health care access shaped by persisting structural racism. A number of community hospitals that once served AA families by providing easy access to care no longer exist. Recently, South Side obstetric unit and hospital closures have increased. Simultaneously, funding is increasingly competitive for community health organizations and federally qualified health centers. Institutions and agencies that do receive funding or adequately allocate funding to include lactation services cannot address breastfeeding barriers within socioeconomically marginalized communities. The unmet funding needs not only affect breastfeeding families but also impede the growth of a multilevel lactation care workforce. Finally, inconsistencies persist between breastfeeding information provided by lactation providers and delivery team care received in the hospital. Despite these barriers, we believe pathways exist to improve breastfeeding rates among South Side AA communities, such as perinatal home visiting services. Stakeholders must recognize the longstanding effects of structural racism and address the inequitable distribution of perinatal care across Chicagoland. Stakeholders must also place value in and be supportive of lactation care providers and the families they serve through both funding and policies.

The Needs Assessment Tool-Cancer (NAT-C) is a validated, structured method of assessing patient/carer concerns and prompting action, to address unmet need. AIMS: Assess feasibility and acceptability of a definitive two-armed cluster randomised trial of NAT-C in primary care by evaluating: recruitment of GP practices, patients and carers; most effective approach of ensuring NAT-C appointments, acceptability of study measures and follow-up. METHODS: Non-blinded, feasibility study in four General Practices, with cluster randomisation to method of NAT-C appointment delivery, and process evaluation. Adults with active cancer were invited to participate with or without carer. Practices cluster randomised (1:1) to Arm I: promotion and use of NAT-C with a NAT-C trained clinician or Arm II: clinician of choice irrespective of training status. Participants completed study questionnaires at: baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months. Patients booked a 20 minute needs-assessment appointment post-baseline. Patients, carers and GP practice staff views regarding the study sought through interviews/focus groups. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively. Qualitative data were analysed thematically, informed by Normalisation Process Theory. Progression to a definitive trial was assessed against feasibility outcomes, relating to: recruitment rate, uptake and delivery of the NAT-C, data collection and quality. RESULTS: Five GP practices approached, four recruited and trained to use the NAT-C. Forty-seven participants and 17 carers recruited. At baseline, 34/47 (72%) participants reported at least one moderate-severe unmet need, confirming study rationale. 32/47 (68%) participants received a NAT-C-guided consultation, 19 of which on Arm I.

Fifteen patient interviews conducted across the whole study and one focus group at each GP practice. Participants supported a definitive study and found measures acceptable. CONCLUSION: The feasibility trial indicated that recruitment rate, intervention uptake and data collection were appropriate, with refinements, for a definitive multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial.

Pooling radiomic features of such data in a statistical analysis is however challenging, as they are sensitive to the variability in scanner models, acquisition protocols and reconstruction settings, which is often unavoidable in a multicentre retrospective analysis. A statistical harmonization strategy called ComBat was utilized in radiomics studies to deal with the “center-effect”. The goal of the present work was to integrate a transfer learning (TL) technique within ComBat—and recently developed alternate versions of ComBat with improved flexibility (M-ComBat) and robustness (B-ComBat)–to allow the use of a previously determined harmonization transform to the radiomic feature values of new patients from an already known center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The proposed TL approach were incorporated in the four versions of ComBat (standard, B, M, and B-M ComBat). The proposed approach was evaluated using a dataset of 189 locally advanced cervical cancer patients from 3 centers, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images, with the clinical endpoint of predicting local failure. The impact performance of the TL approach was evaluated by comparing the harmonization achieved using only parts of the data to the reference (harmonization achieved using all the available data). It was performed through three different machine learning pipelines. RESULTS: The proposed TL technique was successful in harmonizing features of new patients from a known center in all versions of ComBat, leading to predictive models reaching similar performance as the ones developed using the features harmonized with all the data available.

This study attempts to identify high risk areas of schistosomiasis in China by using information value and machine learning. METHODS: The local case distribution from schistosomiasis surveillance data in China between 2005 and 2019 was assessed based on 19 variables including climate, geography, and social economy. Seven models were built in three categories including information value (IV), three machine learning models [logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), generalized boosted model (GBM)], and three coupled models (IV + LR, IV + RF, IV + GBM). Accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), and F1-score were used to evaluate the prediction performance of the models. The optimal model was selected to predict the risk distribution for schistosomiasis. RESULTS: There is a more prone to schistosomiasis epidemic provided that paddy fields, grasslands, less than 2.5 km from the waterway, annual average temperature of 11.5–19.0 °C, annual average rainfall of 1000–1550 mm. IV + GBM had the highest prediction effect (accuracy = 0.878, AUC = 0.902, F1 = 0.920) compared with the other six models. The results of IV + GBM showed that the risk areas are mainly distributed in the coastal regions of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Poyang Lake region, and the Dongting Lake region. High-risk areas are primarily distributed in eastern Changde, western Yueyang, northeastern Yiyang, middle Changsha of Hunan province; southern Jiujiang, northern Nanchang, northeastern Shangrao, eastern Yichun in Jiangxi province; southern Jingzhou, southern Xiantao, middle Wuhan in Hubei province; southern Anqing, northwestern Guichi, eastern Wuhu in Anhui province; middle Meishan, northern Leshan, and the middle of Liangshan in Sichuan province. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of schistosomiasis transmission in China still exists, with high-risk areas relatively concentrated in the coastal regions of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Coupled models of IV and machine learning provide for effective analysis and prediction, forming a scientific basis for evidence-lead surveillance and control.

When estimating ODE parameters from noisy data, a common distribution assumption is using the Gaussian distribution. It is known that the Gaussian distribution is not robust when abnormal data exist. In this article, we develop a hierarchical semiparametric mixed-effects ODE model for longitudinal data under the Bayesian framework. For robust inference on ODE parameters, we consider a class of heavy-tailed distributions to model the random effects of ODE parameters and observations errors. An MCMC method is proposed to sample ODE parameters from the posterior distributions. Our proposed method is illustrated by studying a gene regulation experiment. Simulation studies show that our proposed method provides satisfactory results for the semiparametric mixed-effects ODE models with finite samples.

Alteration of the nuclear pore complex has been observed not only in viruses that replicate in the nucleus but also in viruses with a cytoplasmic replicative cycle. In this last case, the alteration of the NPC can reduce the transport of transcription factors involved in the immune response or mRNA maturation, or inhibit the transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, favoring the translation of viral mRNAs or allowing access to nuclear factors necessary for viral replication. In most cases, the alteration of the NPC is mediated by viral proteins, being the viral proteases, one of the most critical groups of viral proteins that regulate these nucleus–cytoplasmic transport changes.

Quadruplexes are four-stranded nucleic acid secondary structures, which can regulate processes such as transcription, translation, replication and recombination. They are also found in genes linked to virulence in microbes, and ligands that bind to quadruplexes can eliminate drug-resistant pathogens. Using a computational approach, we quantified putative quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) in 1359 genomes across the fungal kingdom and explored their presence in genes related to virulence, drug resistance and biological processes associated with pathogenicity in Aspergillus fumigatus. Here we present the largest analysis of PQS in fungi and identify significant heterogeneity of these sequences throughout phyla, genera and species. PQS were genetically conserved in Aspergillus spp. and frequently pathogenic species appeared to contain fewer PQS than their lesser/non-pathogenic counterparts. GO-term analysis identified that PQS-containing genes were involved in processes linked with virulence such as zinc ion binding, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and regulation of transcription in A. fumigatus. Although the genome frequency of PQS was lower in A. fumigatus, PQS could be found enriched in genes involved in virulence, and genes upregulated during germination and hypoxia. Moreover, PQS were found in genes involved in drug resistance.

Though carbapenems are an effective treatment in the face of rising resistance, overuse drives carbapenem resistance (CR). We hypothesized that resistance to routinely used antimicrobials is common, and, despite frequent use of carbapenems, associated with an increased risk of inappropriate empiric treatment (IET), which in turn worsens clinical outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with a culture-positive non-CR cUTI. Triple resistance (TR) was defined as resistance to > 3 of the following: 3rd generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin. Multivariable models quantified the impact of TR and inappropriate empiric therapy (IET) on mortality, hospital LOS, and costs. RESULTS: Among 23,331 patients with cUTI, 3040 (13.0%) had a TR pathogen. Compared to patients with non-TR, those with TR were more likely male (57.6% vs. 47.7%, p < 0.001), black (17.9% vs. 13.6%, p < 0.001), and in the South (46.3% vs. 41.5%, p < 0.001). Patients with TR had higher chronic (median [IQR] Charlson score 3 [2, 4] vs. 2 [1, 4], p < 0.001) and acute (mechanical ventilation 7.0% vs. 5.0%, p < 0.001; ICU admission 22.3% vs. 18.6%, p < 0.001) disease burden. Despite greater prevalence of empiric carbapenem exposure (43.3% vs. 16.2%, p < 0.001), patient with TR were also more likely to receive IET (19.6% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001) than those with non-TR. Although mortality was similar between groups, TR added 0.38 (95% CI 0.18, 0.49) days to LOS, and $754 (95% CI $406, $1103) to hospital costs. Both TR and IET impacted the outcomes among cUTI patients whose UTI was not catheter-associated (CAUTI), but had no effect on outcomes in CAUTI. CONCLUSIONS: TR occurs in 1 in 8 patients hospitalized with cUTI. It is associated with an increase in the risk of IET exposure, as well as a modest attributable prolongation of LOS and increase in total costs, particularly in the setting of non-CAUTI.

The clinical manifestations of DEN are variable, and the disease may present subclinically or asymptomatically. A quarter of patients develop classical dengue (CD) or severe dengue (SD), which is potentially lethal and involves vascular permeability changes, severe hemorrhage and organ damage. The involvement of the liver is a fairly common feature in DEN, and alterations range from asymptomatic elevation of transaminases to acute liver failure. Since its introduction in Brazil in 1990, two strains of Dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 (DENV-2) have been detected: Lineage I, which is responsible for an outbreak in 1991, and Lineage II, which caused an epidemic greater than the previous one and had a different epidemiological profile. To date, studies on different strains of the same serotype/genotype and their association with disease severity are scarce. In addition, one of the greatest challenges regarding the study of DEN pathogenesis and the development of drug and vaccine therapies is the absence of an animal model that reproduces the disease as it occurs in humans. The main goals of this study were to assess BALB/c mouse susceptibility experimentally infected by two distinct DENV-2 strains and characterize possible differences in the clinical signs and alterations induced in the liver resulting from those infections. Mice infected by the two DENV-2 lineages gained less weight than uninfected mice; however, their livers were slightly heavier. Increased AST and AST levels were observed in infected mice, and the number of platelets increased in the first 72 h of infection and subsequently decreased. Mice infected with both lineages presented leukocytosis but at different times of infection. The histopathological changes induced by both lineages were similar and comparable to the changes observed in DEN fatal cases. The viral genome was detected in two liver samples. The results demonstrate the susceptibility of BALB/c mice to both DENV-2 lineages and suggest that the changes induced by those strains are similar, although for some parameters, they are manifested at different times of infection.",2021-05-06,"Jácome, Fernanda Cunha; Caldas, Gabriela Cardoso; Rasinhas, Arthur da Costa; de Almeida, Ana Luisa Teixeira; de Souza, Daniel Dias Coutinho; Paulino, Amanda Carlos; Leonardo, Raphael; Barth, Ortrud Monika; dos Santos, Flavia Barreto; Barreto-Vieira, Débora Ferreira",Sci Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a73129af540fbb7791d33c7a433eeeeec3626afa.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8102549.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102549/,

We used a statewide client survey in Minnesota to determine needs and priorities of food pantry clients in 2017 and 2019 and to identify how well Minnesota pantries met those needs in 2019. METHODS: Our survey was administered in 2017 and 2019. Food pantries in Minnesota were mailed 25 surveys each, with instructions for administering the surveys anonymously to clients. Descriptive analyses compared 2017 and 2019 data and compared client priorities for foods and services with how often they were available at the pantry in 2019. RESULTS: The 2017 survey represented 4,321 clients from 188 pantries; the 2019 survey represented 5,529 clients from 220 pantries. Most measures of food pantry use were consistently high across the years; about three-quarters of clients had been visiting the pantry for a year or more. In 2019, 85% of clients said it was important to have fresh fruits and vegetables, but only 52% said these were always available. About two-thirds had a household member with a diet-related chronic disease. The ability to choose their own foods was clients’ top priority.

Southeast Asia experienced severe dengue outbreaks in 2019, and over 1000 cases had been reported in Jiangxi, a previously known low-epidemic region in China. However, the emergence of a dengue virus epidemic in a non-epidemic region remains unclear. METHODS: We enrolled 154 dengue fever patients from four hospitals in Jiangxi, from April 2019 to September 2019. Real-time PCR, NS1 antigen rapid test, and IgM, IgG tests were performed, and 14 samples were outsourced to be sequenced metagenomically. RESULTS: Among the 154 cases, 42 were identified as imported and most of them returned from Cambodia. A total of 113 blood samples were obtained and 106 were identified as DENV-1, two as DENV-2, and five were negative through RT-PCR. All DENV-1 strains sequenced in this study were all classified to one cluster and owned a high similarity with a Cambodia strain isolated in 2019. The evolutionary relationships of amino acid were consistent with that of nucleotide genome result. The sequence-based findings of Jiangxi strains were consistent with epidemiological investigation.

We used a Markov microsimulation cohort model to simulate the DFU monthly progression over the lifetime horizon. Our study employed a mixed method design with model inputs including data from interventional and observational studies, French databases and expert opinion. The demographic characteristics of the simulated population and clinical efficacy were based on the EXPLORER double-blind randomized controlled trial. Health-related quality of life, costs, and resource use inputs were taken from the literature relevant to the French context. The main outcomes included life-years without DFU (LYs(w/DFU)), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), amputations, and lifetime costs. To assess the robustness of the results, sensitivity and subgroup analyses based on the wound duration at treatment initiation were performed. Treatment with the TLC-NOSF dressing led to total cost savings per patient of EUR 35,489, associated with gains of 0.50 LY(w/DFU) and 0.16 QALY. TLC-NOSF dressings were established as the dominant strategy in the base case and all sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, the model revealed that, for every 100 patients treated with TLC-NOSF dressings, two amputations could be avoided. According to the subgroup analysis results, the sooner the TLC-NOSF treatment was initiated, the better were the outcomes, with the highest benefits for ulcers with a duration of two months or less (+0.65 LY(w/DFU), +0.23 QALY, and cost savings of EUR 55,710). The results from the French perspective are consistent with the ones from the German and British perspectives. TLC-NOSF dressings are cost-saving compared to neutral dressings, leading to an increase in patients’ health benefits and a decrease in the associated treatment costs. These results can thus be used to guide healthcare decisionmakers. The potential savings could represent EUR 3,345 per treated patient per year and even reach EUR 4,771 when TLC-NOSF dressings are used as first line treatment.

Respiratory system involvement is the most common manifestation in symptomatic patients. In this literature review, we describe the diagnosis, management, and implications of pulmonary hypertension (PH) among patients with COVID-19. We defined pulmonary hypertension as increasing mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of ≥ 25 mm Hg at rest. In our literature search, we identified 4 articles with details on pulmonary hypertension. Among these, two reported various echocardiographic details for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension. In 1 study evidence of pulmonary hypertension was noted in 13.4% of patients. Patients with severe COVID-19 were reported to have a higher proportion of pulmonary hypertension as compared to mild COVID-19 disease [22% vs 2%]. Elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was significant in predicting mortality. COVID-19 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial injury, pulmonary embolism, and prior pulmonary hypertension were at a higher risk of worsening pulmonary hypertension. Multiple mechanisms for developing pulmonary hypertension that have been postulated are i) concomitant worsening myocardial injury, ii) cytokine storm, endothelial injury, hypercoagulability attributing to development of venous thromboembolism, iii) and the presence of thrombotic microangiopathy. Among patients with severe COVID-19 disease and pulmonary hypertension, complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, the requirement of intensive care unit admission, the requirement of mechanical ventilation, and mortality are higher.

In this study, we analyzed the intracellular traffic of IgG mediated by the human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in fibroblast cell lines with trisomy 21. Intracellular IgG trafficking studies in live cells showed that fibroblasts with trisomy 21 exhibit higher proportion of IgG in lysosomes (~ 10% increase), decreased IgG content in intracellular vesicles (~ 9% decrease), and a trend towards decreased IgG recycling (~ 55% decrease) in comparison to diploid cells. Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) overexpression in diploid fibroblasts replicated the increase in IgG sorting to the degradative pathway observed in cells with trisomy 21. The impact of APP on the expression of FCGRT (alpha chain component of FcRn) was investigated by APP knock down and overexpression of the APP protein. APP knock down increased the expression of FCGRT mRNA by ~ 60% in both diploid and trisomic cells. Overexpression of APP in diploid fibroblasts and HepG2 cells resulted in a decrease in FCGRT and FcRn expression.

However, there are no published data on the cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam for vHABP/VABP. These nosocomial infections are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, and are increasingly complicated by growing rates of resistance and the inappropriate use of antimicrobials. This study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam compared with meropenem for the treatment of vHABP/VABP in a US hospital setting. METHODS: A short-term decision tree followed by a long-term Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years associated with ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem in the treatment of patients with vHABP/VABP. Pathogen susceptibility and clinical efficacy were informed by the Program to Assess Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Susceptibility (PACTS) database and ASPECT-NP, respectively. A US healthcare sector perspective was adopted, capturing direct costs borne by third-party payers or integrated health systems, and direct health effects for patients. RESULTS: In the confirmed treatment setting (post-susceptibility results), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem was US$12,126 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY); this reduced when used in the early treatment setting (before susceptibility results) at $4775/QALY. CONCLUSION: Ceftolozane/tazobactam represents a highly cost-effective treatment option for patients with vHABP/VABP versus meropenem when used in either the confirmed or early treatment setting; with increased cost-effectiveness shown in the early setting.

While septic acute kidney injury generates new morbidity in pediatric critically ill patients, acquired morbidities and functional status of CKRT population are unknown. We predicted that CKRT survivors are at risk for new morbidity and would have worse functional status at PICU discharge compared to baseline, and aimed to describe associated factors. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study over 24 months of CKRT patients surviving to PICU discharge in a quaternary children’s hospital. Functional outcome was determined by Functional Status Scale (FSS). RESULTS: FSS scores were higher at PICU and hospital discharge compared to baseline. Of 45 CKRT survivors, 31 (69%) had worse FSS score at PICU discharge and 51% had new morbidity (≥3 increase in FSS); majority qualified as moderate to severe disability (FSS ≥10). Four patients (9%) had new tracheostomy, 3 (7%) were ventilator dependent, and 10 (22%) were dialysis dependent. Most (23/45, 51%) required outpatient rehabilitation. Cumulative days on sedation, controlled for illness severity, were independently associated with worse FSS at PICU discharge (aOR 25.18 (3.73, 169.92)). In adjusted analyses, duration of sedation was associated with new morbidity, while neurologic comorbidity, percent fluid overload at CKRT start, and nonrenal comorbidity were associated with moderate to severe disability at PICU discharge when controlled for baseline FSS. CONCLUSIONS: CKRT survivors, with new morbidity and worse functional outcomes at PICU discharge, are a newly described vulnerable population requiring targeted follow-up. Deliberate decrease of sedation exposure in patients with decreased clearance due to organ dysfunction needs to be studied as a modifiable risk factor.

While these therapies hold great promise, they face the same limitation as other kinase inhibitors, the emergence of resistant mechanisms. The biology behind KRAS G12C inhibitor resistance has been investigated with genome-wide approaches, in the hopes of finding a way to improve the efficacy of these new molecules. Here, we review the biology of KRAS G12C, mechanisms of drug resistance and potential approaches to overcome the later. ABSTRACT: Lung cancer represents the most common form of cancer, accounting for 1.8 million deaths globally in 2020. Over the last decade the treatment for advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer have dramatically improved largely thanks to the emergence of two therapeutic breakthroughs: the discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeting of oncogenic driver alterations. While these therapies hold great promise, they face the same limitation as other inhibitors: the emergence of resistant mechanisms. One such alteration in non-small cell lung cancer is the Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (KRAS) oncogene. KRAS mutations are the most common oncogenic driver in NSCLC, representing roughly 20–25% of cases. The mutation is almost exclusively detected in adenocarcinoma and is found among smokers 90% of the time. Along with the development of new drugs that have been showing promising activity, resistance mechanisms have begun to be clarified. The aim of this review is to unwrap the biology of KRAS in NSCLC with a specific focus on primary and secondary resistance mechanisms and their possible clinical implications.",2021-05-21,"Addeo, Alfredo; Banna, Giuseppe Luigi; Friedlaender, Alex",Cancers (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/413c9ac4649b182da97119874a00e14063612393.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8196854.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8196854/,

We aimed to systematically evaluate between-trial heterogeneity in reporting standards and trial outcome. METHODS: A systematic review of RCTs published between 2000 and 2019 was performed including adult ARDS patients receiving lung-protective ventilation. A random-effects meta-regression model was applied to quantify heterogeneity (non-random variability) and to evaluate trial and patient characteristics as sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: In total, 67 RCTs were included. The 28-day control-group mortality rate ranged from 10 to 67% with large non-random heterogeneity (I(2) = 88%, p < 0.0001). Reported baseline patient characteristics explained some of the outcome heterogeneity, but only six trials (9%) reported all four independently predictive variables (mean age, mean lung injury score, mean plateau pressure and mean arterial pH). The 28-day control group mortality adjusted for patient characteristics (i.e. the residual heterogeneity) ranged from 18 to 45%. Trials with significant benefit in the primary outcome reported a higher control group mortality than trials with an indeterminate outcome or harm (mean 28-day control group mortality: 44% vs. 28%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Among ARDS RCTs in the lung-protective ventilation era, there was large variability in the description of baseline characteristics and significant unexplainable heterogeneity in 28-day control group mortality. These findings signify problems with the generalizability of ARDS research and underline the urgent need for standardized reporting of trial and baseline characteristics.

While these responses to expectancy violations have been critical for understanding early cognition, interpreting them is challenging because infants’ responses are highly variable. This variability has been treated as an unavoidable nuisance inherent to infant research. Here we asked whether the variability contains signal in addition to noise: namely, whether some infants show consistently stronger responses to expectancy violations than others. Infants watched two unrelated physical events 6 mo apart; these events culminated in either an impossible or an expected outcome. We found that infants who exhibited the strongest looking response to an impossible event at 11 mo also exhibited the strongest response to an entirely different impossible event at 17 mo. Furthermore, violation-of-expectation responses in infancy predicted children’s explanation-based curiosity at 3 y old. In contrast, there was no longitudinal relation between infants’ responses to events with expected outcomes at 11 and 17 mo, nor any link with later curiosity; hence, infants’ responses do not merely reflect individual differences in attention but are specific to expectancy violations.

This study aimed to identify the perinatal and postnatal factors associated with hypertension in children born very low birth weight. RESULTS: Forty-six children aged ≥ 6 years from the VLBW cohort of Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand underwent the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The prevalence of hypertension was 15.2% (7/46). The hypertension group had a significant higher BMI z-score at 3 years of age (0.90 ± 1.44 vs − 0.45 ± 1.47, p = 0.045) and a greater proportion of current obesity (42% vs 2.5%, p < 0.01) compared to those in the normotensive group. Multivariate analysis revealed that current obesity was associated with hypertension (OR 34.77, 95%CI 1.814–666.5).

The risk factors affecting the survival and multidrug-resistance of tuberculosis patients were examined. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used to assess the differences in survival among the patients, while Cox regression model was used for multivariate analysis. The qualitative data was tested with chi-square test in the single factor analysis of multidrug-resistant TB. Multivariate analysis was performed using binary logistic regression analysis. The significance level for all the tests were set at 0.05. The mean period of the follow-up of patients was 10 months. In the 337 patients, 33 (9.8%) died, the 21-month survival rate was 90.2%.

Negative-pressure wound therapy can enhance drainage and reduce the empyema cavity, potentially leading to early recovery. This therapy is not currently indicated for bronchopleural fistulas because of the risk of insufficient respiration due to air loss from the fistula. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man, who was malnourished because of peritoneal dialysis, was referred to our hospital for the treatment of lung cancer. Right lower lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed via posterolateral thoracotomy, and the bronchial stump was covered with the intercostal muscle flap. His postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged. However, he was readmitted to our hospital because of respiratory failure and diagnosed as having bronchopleural fistula on the basis of the bronchoscopic finding of a 10-mm hole at the membranous portion of the inlet of the remnant lower lobe bronchus. Thus, thoracotomy debridement and open window thoracostomy were immediately performed. After achieving infection control, bronchial occlusion was performed using fibrin glue and a polyglycolic acid sheet was inserted through a fenestrated wound. Bronchial fistula closure was observed on bronchoscopy; therefore, a negative-pressure wound therapy system was applied to close the fenestrated wound. The collapsed lung was re-expanded and the granulation tissue around the wound increased; therefore, thoracic cavity size decreased and thoracoplasty using the latissimus dorsi was performed. CONCLUSIONS: This bronchopleural fistula was treated successfully after a right lower lobectomy using an extra-pleural bronchial occlusion and negative-pressure wound therapy.",2021-03-02,"Iwasaki, Masashi; Shimomura, Masanori; Ii, Tsunehiro",Surg Case Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/97f8c6de2ebad32a7f17f1d880e9fad6c8ec598f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7922724.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7922724/,

In this retrospective study, we aimed to define the clinical phenotype, laboratory features, and treatment outcomes of CQ/HCQ myopathy, as well as the safety profile of these drugs. We identified 13 patients seen between 2000 and 2019, with a median age at presentation of 66 years (range 53–89); 11 were females. At onset of symptoms, patients were on CQ or HCQ for a minimum of 6 months and up to 21 years. Diagnosis was often delayed by a median of 6 months (range 3–48). At presentation, 13 patients reported limb weakness, with five requiring assistance in walking. Ten reported dysphagia, often severe, resulting in marked weight loss or aspiration pneumonia. Nine reported respiratory symptoms, which were multifactorial in four, and four reported severe neck weakness. Myopathy clinical phenotype showed predominant involvement of one or more of the following: proximal limb muscle weakness (12 patients), dysphagia (9), axial weakness (4), and respiratory failure (5). Eleven patients had a cardiac evaluation showing prolonged QT interval in 10 and CQ/HCQ cardiomyopathy (CMP) in four. Ten out of 12 patients markedly improved after discontinuing the medication, but most were left with some residual weakness. Eleven patients had a muscle biopsy showing a myopathy with rimmed vacuoles and marked acid phosphatase reactivity. Nine had elevated creatine kinase level up to 1,199 U/L. Twelve patients had an electromyography (EMG), which showed myopathic motor unit potentials with fibrillation potentials in 11 and myotonic discharges in 3. Higher cumulative dose and longer exposure duration were associated with more severe disability and more common cardiac and swallow involvement, indicating a cumulative dose effect. Herein, we demonstrate that long-term exposure to CQ and HCQ may result in a myopathy with a wide spectrum of clinical presentation and predilection for swallowing, respiratory, and cardiac muscles, often with marked associated morbidity.

In order to assess the impact of diagnostic information on subsequent treatment strategies regarding patient-relevant outcomes, randomized test-treatment studies were introduced. Various designs for randomized test-treatment studies, including an evaluation of biomarkers as part of randomized biomarker-guided treatment studies, are suggested in the literature, but the nomenclature is not consistent. METHODS: The aim was to provide a clear description of the different study designs within a pre-specified framework, considering their underlying assumptions, advantages as well as limitations and derivation of effect sizes required for sample size calculations. Furthermore, an outlook on adaptive designs within randomized test-treatment studies is given. RESULTS: The need to integrate adaptive design procedures in randomized test-treatment studies is apparent. The derivation of effect sizes induces that sample size calculation will always be based on rather vague assumptions resulting in over- or underpowered study results. Therefore, it might be advantageous to conduct a sample size re-estimation based on a nuisance parameter during the ongoing trial. CONCLUSIONS: Due to their increased complexity, compared to common treatment trials, the implementation of randomized test-treatment studies poses practical challenges including a huge uncertainty regarding study parameters like the expected outcome in specific subgroups or disease prevalence which might affect the sample size calculation. Since research on adaptive designs within randomized test-treatment studies is limited so far, further research is recommended.

In the United Kingdom, studies using secondary data sources have documented temporal variations in levels of arts engagement in the population, its determinants and its mental wellbeing implications. However, arts engagement is often characterized by prioritizing “high-brow” art forms. In this article, we introduce the HEartS Survey, a tool that aims to increase the balance between inclusivity and brevity of existing arts engagement measures and to focus specifically on the connection between arts engagement and social wellbeing. We explore trends in participatory and receptive engagement with literary, visual, performing, crafts and decorative arts among 5,338 adults in the UK in 2018–2019 using summative engagement scores and cluster analysis. Regression models, adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, health, and social covariates, examine correlations between arts engagement and psychological and social wellbeing measures. Over 97% of respondents reported engagement in one or more arts activities at least once during 2018–2019, with reading and listening to music being the most popular activities. Arts engagement grouped into three distinct clusters: 19.8% constituted “low engagers” whose main source of engagement was occasional reading; 44.4% constituted “receptive consumers” who read and listened to music frequently and engaged with popular receptive arts activities such as cinema, live music, theater, exhibitions, and museums; and 35.8% constituted “omnivores” who frequently engaged in almost all arts activities. In agreement with existing studies, more arts engagement was associated with higher levels of wellbeing, social connectedness, and lower odds of intense social loneliness. In contrast, we found a positive association between more arts engagement, depression, and intense emotional loneliness for the most highly engaged omnivores.

OBJECTIVES: Describe susceptibility patterns to several antimicrobials in gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients causing HAIs at three private tertiary care hospitals in Saudi Arabia over a 5-year period. METHODS: Data on trends of antimicrobial susceptibility among bacteria causing HAIs events in children and adults at three tertiary private hospitals located in Riyadh and Qassim, Saudi Arabia, were collected retrospectively between 2015 and 2019 using the surveillance data datasets. RESULTS: Over a 5-year period, 38,624 pathogens caused 17,539 HAI events in 17,566 patients. About 9450 (53.8%) of patients who suffered HAIs were females and the average age was 41.7 ± 14.3 years (78.1% were adults and 21.9% were children). Gram-negative pathogens were 2.3-times more likely to cause HAIs compared to gram-positive bacteria (71.9% vs. 28.1%). The ranking of causative pathogens in decreasing order was: Escherichia coli (38%), Klebsiella species (15.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (12.6%). Gram-positive isolates were mostly susceptible to linezolid (91.8%) whereas they were resistant to ampicillin (52.6%), cefoxitin (54.2%), and doxycycline (55.9%). Gram-negative isolates were mostly sensitive to tigecycline (95%) whereas they were resistant to cefotaxime (49.5%) and cefixime (59.6%). During the 5 years, there were relatively stable susceptibility patterns to all tested antimicrobials, except for cefotaxime which shown a susceptibility reduction by 41.4%, among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. An increase in the susceptibility of Acinetobacter and Enterobacter and Citrobacter species to all studied antimicrobials was observed except for colistin that had a slight sensitivity reduction in 2019 by 4.3% against Acinetobacter species. However, we noted reduced sensitivity of MRSA, CoNS and Enterococcus species to gentamicin; and increased resistance of MRSA to linezolid and vancomycin. CONCLUSION: The observed increase in susceptibility of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to studied antimicrobials is important; however, reduced sensitivity of MRSA, CoNS and Enterococcus species to gentamicin; and increased resistance of MRSA to linezolid and vancomycin is a serious threat and calls for effective antimicrobial stewardship programs.",2021-06-12,"Alhumaid, Saad; Al Mutair, Abbas; Al Alawi, Zainab; Alzahrani, Ahmad J.; Tobaiqy, Mansour; Alresasi, Ahmed M.; Bu-Shehab, Ibrahim; Al-Hadary, Issa; Alhmeed, Naif; Alismail, Mossa; Aldera, Ahmed H.; AlHbabi, Fadhil; Al-Shammari, Haifa; Rabaan, Ali A.; Al-Omari, Awad",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/48c674e5e73863214e42a8c4ea3f1022f672df5b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8196925.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8196925/,

Our objective was to examine disparities in preventive oral health care among US adults with diabetes. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011–2016. Periodontal examinations were conducted in adults aged 30 and older. We compared the weighted prevalence of periodontal disease and the practice of preventive oral health care, including practicing dental interproximal cleaning (flossing or using other interproximal cleaning devices) and use of preventive dental services, among people with and without diabetes. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to examine the relationship between the presence of diabetes, periodontal disease, and preventive oral health care practices. RESULTS: Weighted prevalence of periodontal disease in the US population was higher among adults with diabetes than those without (58.0% vs 37.6%). This difference persisted after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and smoking status.

This study was undertaken to investigate prevalence of G. anatis in 12 poultry flocks originating from Iranian provinces with leading chicken production and to determine genetic diversity, antimicrobial resistance, and the presence of major antigens of the isolates investigated. Out of the 120 chicken tracheal samples collected and tested, 84 (70%) were positive for G. anatis. Genotyping by Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis and genome sequencing revealed a total of 24 pulsotypes for 71 strains (at a 87% similarity level) and seven genome clusters comprising 21 strains (97% similarity level), respectively. The combination of the two typing methods confirmed the presence of several genotypes originating from a common ancestor affecting poultry yet also suggested that identical clones were shared among chickens within farms and between different farms. The latter finding is to our knowledge the first example of clonal presence of G. anatis in epidemiologically unrelated farms. The 21 sequenced strains were characterized against a panel of commonly used antibiotics and showed lowered sensitivity to tetracycline (76.2%) and enrofloxacin (90.5%). The widespread presence of multiresistant G. anatis isolates calls for non-antibiotic prophylactics. Three major immunogen genes, gtxA, Gab_1309 and Gab_2312 were detected in the isolates indicating these antigens likely represent effective vaccine targets.

The big turnover in patients in the community pharmacy makes it possible to reach a great number of patients and collect a lot of data in a relatively short time. However, conducting nation-wide research and development projects can be a rather time-consuming process for the individual community pharmacy, and can thus require collaboration with other community pharmacies and researchers. This will help ensure strong results and better implementation. Thus, the Danish Network for Community Pharmacy Practice for Research and Development (NUAP) was established in Denmark by a number of highly committed community pharmacies and researchers.

As so, new solutions to provide more efficient and affordable support to this group of patients are needed. Such solutions should never discard the user and instead should focus on promoting more healthy lifestyles and provide tools for patients’ active participation in the treatment and management of their diseases. In this concern, the Personal Health Empowerment (PHE) project presented in this paper aims to empower patients to monitor and improve their health, using personal data and technology assisted coaching. The work described in this paper focuses on defining an approach for user modelling on patients with chronic obstructive respiratory diseases using a hybrid modelling approach to identify different groups of users. A classification model with 90.4% prediction accuracy was generated combining agglomerative hierarchical clustering and decision tree classification techniques. Furthermore, this model identified 5 clusters which describe characteristics of 5 different types of users according to 7 generated rules. With the modelling approach defined in this study, a personalized coaching solution will be built considering patients with different necessities and capabilities and adapting the support provided, enabling the recognition of early signs of exacerbations and objective self-monitoring and treatment of the disease. The novel factor of this approach resides in the possibility to integrate personalized coaching technologies adapted to each kind of user within a smartphone-based application resulting in a reliable and affordable alternative for patients to manage their disease.",2021-01-30,"Martinho, Diogo; Freitas, Alberto; Sá-Sousa, Ana; Vieira, Ana; Meira, Jorge; Martins, Constantino; Marreiros, Goreti",J Med Syst,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/dd760a35bfd2730f5ca0dbeba393512d24411c3f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7847234.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847234/,

A population-based prospective study included 1443 nondiabetic subjects at baseline, and they were examined for developing T2D after 5-year follow-up. Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) of rs9939609 to the future T2D in the models adjusted for the confounding factors including socio-economic status, lifestyle factors (smoking and drinking history, sporting habits, and leisure time), and clinical patterns (obese status, blood pressures, and dyslipidemia) at baseline. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to measure the power to predict individuals with T2D. The FTO-rs9939609 polymorphism was a significant predictor of future T2D in the model unadjusted, and it remained significant in the final model after adjustment for the confounding factors, showing an additive effect of the A-allele (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.02–1.78, P = 0.036, AUC = 0.676).

However, the mechanism underlying allosteric activation of SIRT6 by the activator MDL-801 remains largely elusive because no major conformational changes are observed upon activator binding. By combining molecular dynamics simulations with biochemical and kinetic analyses of wild-type SIRT6 and its variant M136A, we show that conformational rotation of 2-methyl-4-fluoro-5-bromo substituent on the right phenyl ring (R-ring) of MDL-801, which uncovers previously unseen hydrophobic interactions, contributes to increased activating deacetylation activity of SIRT6. This hypothesis is further supported by the two newly synthesized MDL-801 derivatives through the removal of the 5-Br atom on the R-ring (MDL-801-D1) or the restraint of the rotation of the R-ring (MDL-801-D2). We further propose that the 5-Br atom serves as an allosteric driver that controls the ligand allosteric efficacy.

METHODS: This search will be performed in four databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus, as well as in the grey literature. The studies selection process will be reported through the PRISMA Statement diagram model. All studies describing the molecular mechanisms possibly involved in the development of malformations caused by embryonic/fetal ZIKV exposure in animal models with an appropriate control group and methodology will be included (including, for instance, randomized and non-randomized studies). All animals used as experimental models for ZIKV teratogenesis may be included as long as exposure to the virus occurred during the embryonic/fetal period. From the selected studies, data will be extracted using a previously prepared standard form. Bias risk evaluation will be conducted following the SYRCLE’s Risk of Bias tool. All data obtained will be tabulated and organized by outcomes (morphological and molecular). DISCUSSION: With the proposed systematic review, we expect to present results about the methodological quality of the published studies with animal models that investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the teratogenic effect of ZIKV, as well as to show the studies with greater reliability.

Conversely, inhibiting ECM degradation and MMP1 expression restored melanoma invasion. Primary cutaneous melanomas of aged humans show more cancer cells invade as single cells at the invasive front of melanomas expressing and depositing more collagen, and collagen and single melanoma cell invasion are robust predictors of poor melanoma-specific survival. Thus, primary melanomas arising over collagen-degraded skin are less invasive, and reduced invasion improves survival.

However, some side effects, such as osteoclast activation have emerged when it was used at high doses. In this study, by considering the osteoclast-suppressing capability of melatonin (MEL), its effect on osteoclast differentiation induced by BMP-2 was investigated. These two factors, MEL and BMP-2, were embedded into chitosan/hydroxyapatite (HAp) scaffolds that were characterized morphologically by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro-computed tomography (μ-CT). Release profiles of MEL and BMP-2 from scaffolds were determined in vitro and then, the differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells to osteoclasts was investigated on the scaffolds. Results of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, SEM imaging and expression of cathepsin K gene showed that, in the presence of BMP-2, osteoclast differentiation increased, whereas it decreased in MEL and MEL/BMP-2 embedded scaffolds suggesting that melatonin successfully attenuated osteoclast differentiation induced by BMP-2. Thus, the MEL/BMP-2 loaded chitosan/HAp scaffolds that have dual function in enhancing bone formation and inhibiting osteoclast activity are recommended biomaterials in the field of bone regeneration.

Using genomic profiles of the tumor and drug information can help in tailoring the most efficient treatment for a patient. In this paper, we proposed a classification machine learning approach that predicts the sensitive/resistant drugs for a cell line. It can be performed by using both drug and cell line similarities, one of the cell line or drug similarities, or even not using any similarity information. This paper investigates the influence of using previously defined as well as two newly introduced similarities on predicting anti-cancer drug sensitivity. The proposed method uses max concentration thresholds for assigning drug responses to class labels. Its performance was evaluated using stratified five-fold cross-validation on cell line-drug pairs in two datasets. Assessing the predictive powers of the proposed model and three sets of methods, including state-of-the-art classification methods, state-of-the-art regression methods, and off-the-shelf classification machine learning approaches shows that the proposed method outperforms other methods. Moreover, The efficiency of the model is evaluated in tissue-specific conditions. Besides, the novel sensitive associations predicted by this model were verified by several supportive evidence in the literature and reliable database.

A simple screening tool may support risk stratification, identification, and appropriate management of at-risk patients. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated and compared the accuracy and clinical utility of existing screening questionnaires for identifying OSA in different clinical cohorts. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies assessing the diagnostic value of OSA screening questionnaires. We identified prospective studies, validated against polysomnography, and published to December 2020 from online databases. To pool the results, we used random effects bivariate binomial meta-analysis. RESULTS: We included 38 studies across three clinical cohorts in the meta-analysis. In the sleep clinic cohort, the Berlin questionnaire’s pooled sensitivity for apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) ≥ 5, ≥ 15, and ≥ 30 was 85%, 84%, and 89%, and pooled specificity was 43%, 30%, and 33%, respectively. The STOP questionnaire’s pooled sensitivity for AHI ≥ 5, ≥ 15, and ≥ 30 was 90%, 90%, and 95%, and pooled specificity was 31%, 29%, and 21%. The pooled sensitivity of the STOP-Bang questionnaire for AHI ≥ 5, ≥ 15, and ≥ 30 was 92%, 95%, and 96%, and pooled specificity was 35%, 27%, and 28%.

Given that depression is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease, it could affect the use of healthcare. This study aims to examine the association between the severity of new-onset depression and unmet healthcare needs among South Korean adults. METHODS: Data from 15,588 participants, derived from the 2014, 2016, and 2018 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, were examined. Only individuals who were not diagnosed with depression was included to exclude those who visited hospitals to treat depression or were experiencing unmet healthcare needs due to depression. Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and unmet healthcare needs acted as the dependent variable. A multiple/multinomial logistic regression analysis was built to analyze the association between the variables. RESULTS: Individuals with severe depression had a higher risk of having unmet healthcare needs compared to those without (men: adjusted OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.40–3.00; women: adjusted OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.72–2.82). White-collar men with severe depression also had a higher risk of having unmet healthcare needs (adjusted OR = 9.72, 95% CI = 4.73–20.00). Individuals with severe depression had a higher risk of having unmet healthcare needs due to economic hardship than those without depression (men: adjusted OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.76–5.14, women: adjusted OR = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.96–4.38). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a significant relationship between the severity of new-onset depression and the risk of having unmet healthcare needs among South Korean adults.

The aim of this study is to design and apply a composed and stage-approach therapy combining antibiotherapy, surgical treatment, and photo-biomodulation (PBM) for the prevention or treatment of MRONJ lesions. Materials and Methods: The proposed treatment protocol was carried out in the Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery of the “Victor Babes” University of Medicine and Farmacy of Timisoara, in 2018–2020. A total of 241 patients who were previously exposed to antiresorptive or anti-angiogenic therapy, as well as patients already diagnosed with MRONJ at different stages of the disease were treated. A preventive protocol was applied for patients in an “at risk” stage. Patients in more advanced stages received a complex treatment. Results: The healing proved to be complete, with spontaneous bone coverage in all the n = 84 cases placed in an “at risk” stage. For the n = 49 patients belonging to stage 0, pain reductions and decreases of mucosal inflammations were also obtained in all cases. For the n = 108 patients proposed for surgery (i.e., in stages 1, 2, or 3 of MRONJ), a total healing rate of 91.66% was obtained after the first surgery, while considering the downscaling to stage 1 as a treatment “success”, only one “failure” was reported. This brings the overall “success” rate to 96.68% for a complete healing, and to 99.59% when downscaling to stage 1 is included in the healing rate. Conclusions: Therefore, the clinical outcome of the present study indicates that patients with MRONJ in almost all stages of the disease can benefit from such a proposed association of methods, with superior clinical results compared to classical therapies.",2021-02-05,"Nica, Diana Florina; Riviș, Mircea; Roi, Ciprian Ioan; Todea, Carmen Darinca; Duma, Virgil-Florin; Sinescu, Cosmin",Medicina (Kaunas),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0849c3d34882e287e2223ae48215eaa83692a21b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7914693.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7914693/,

Chlamydia psittaci, the causative agent, affects most categories of birds, livestock, companion animals, and humans. It has many obscured characters and epidemiological dimensions, which makes it unique among other bacterial agents. Recent reports on transmission from equine to humans alarmed the public health authorities, and it necessitates the importance of routine screening of this infectious disease. High prevalence of spill-over infection in equines was associated with reproductive losses. Newer avian chlamydial species are being reported in the recent years. It is a potential biological warfare agent and the disease is an occupational hazard mainly to custom officers handling exotic birds. Prevalence of the disease in wild birds, pet birds, and poultry causes economic losses to the poultry industry and the pet bird trade. Interestingly, there are speculations on the ‘legal’ and ‘illegal’ bird trade that may be the global source of some of the most virulent strains of this pathogen. The mortality rate generally ranges from 5 to 40% in untreated cases, but it can sometimes be higher in co-infection. The intracellular lifestyle of this pathogen makes the diagnosis more complicated and there is also lack of accurate diagnostics. Resistance to antibiotics is reported only in some pathogens of the Chlamydiaceae family, but routine screening may assess the actual situation in all pathogens. Due to the diverse nature of the pathogen, the organism necessitates the One Health partnerships to have complete understanding. The present review focuses on the zoonotic aspects of avian chlamydiosis with its new insights into the pathogenesis, transmission, treatment, prevention, and control strategies. The review also briefs on the basic understandings and complex epidemiology of avian chlamydiosis, highlighting the need for research on emerging one health perspectives.",2021-07-27,"Ravichandran, Karthikeyan; Anbazhagan, Subbaiyan; Karthik, Kumaragurubaran; Angappan, Madesh; Dhayananth, Balusamy",Trop Anim Health Prod,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f016a5c5a6efcb882e34a3a974dd6164817e9c03.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8313243.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8313243/,

Here, we asked whether keratinocyte activity is also required for normal cold and heat sensation. Using calcium imaging, we determined that keratinocyte cold activity is conserved across mammalian species and requires the release of intracellular calcium through one or more unknown cold-sensitive proteins. Both epidermal cell optogenetic inhibition and interruption of ATP-P2X4 signaling reduced reflexive behavioral responses to cold and heat stimuli.

This paper reports on the implementation and evaluation of Schwartz Rounds® (Rounds) in UK healthcare organizations, predominantly part of the National Health Service (NHS). Rounds are one-hour, typically monthly, multidisciplinary forums during which clinical and nonclinical healthcare staff discuss the emotional and social demands of delivering patient care. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of Rounds attendance on the psychological distress, work engagement, compassion and self-reflection of healthcare staff. METHODS: We used a pre-post control design to assess the effect of Rounds attendance across 10 UK healthcare organizations. This design was most appropriate given the voluntary nature of Rounds and ensured the study had ecological validity. Self-reported data were collected from attenders and non-attenders at baseline and at eight-months follow-up. The outcomes were psychological distress, work engagement, compassion and self-reflection. RESULTS: During the 8 months’ study duration, regular attenders (N = 51) attended Rounds on average 4 times (2–8). Attenders showed a significantly greater decrease in psychological distress (as measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)) than non-attenders (N = 233; odds ratio of 0.197; 95% confidence interval (0.047–0.823)). However, Rounds attendance had no significant effect on work engagement, compassion and self-reflection. CONCLUSIONS: Rounds attendance was linked to a 19% reduction in psychological distress adjusting for covariates. As an organization-wide intervention, Rounds thus constitute an effective, relatively low-cost intervention to assist staff in dealing with the demands of their work and to improve their well-being.

In this study, we aim to improve our understanding of the biodiversity of Kidderia (Dall 1876) through molecular and morphological comparisons of Antarctic and Subantarctic taxa. The microbivalves of the genus Kidderia are small brooding organisms that inhabit intertidal and shallow subtidal rocky ecosystems. This genus represents an interesting model to test the vicariance and dispersal hypothesis in the biogeography of the SO. However, the description of Kidderia species relies on a few morphological characters and biogeographic records that raise questions about the true diversity in the group. Here we will define the specimens collected with genetic tools, delimiting their respective boundaries across provinces of the SO, validating the presence of two species of Kidderia. Through the revision of taxonomic issues and species delimitation, it was possible to report that the Antarctic species is Kidderia subquadrata and the species recorded in the Subantarctic islands Diego Ramirez, South Georgia and the Kerguelen Archipelago is Kidderia minuta. The divergence time estimation suggests the origin and diversification of Kidderia lineages are related to historical vicariant processes probably associated with the separation of the continental landmasses close to the late Eocene.

Brain tissue was analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular analyses, and spleens by flow cytometry. To determine the impact of CARD9 deficiency on T cell responses in vitro, antigen presentation assays were utilized. Genetic ablation of CARD9 enhanced early pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and accelerated infiltration of T and B cells in the brain, together with a transient increase in TMEV-infected cells in the hippocampus. CARD9(−/−) mice showed an increased loss of neuronal nuclear protein(+) mature neurons and doublecortin(+) neuronal precursor cells and an increase in β-amyloid precursor protein(+) damaged axons in the hippocampus. No effect of CARD9 deficiency was found on the initiation of CD8(+) T cell responses by flow cytometry and co-culture experiments using virus-exposed dendritic cells or microglia-enriched glial cell mixtures, respectively.

We investigated patient and parent perspectives on a newly implemented parental short-acting beta-agonist administration program. A convenience sample of families participating in this program was approached for study enrolment. The primary outcome was the proportion of parents and children who were satisfied with the program. We also evaluated the program's safety and impact on asthma education as reported by parents. RESULTS: From February 2019 to March 2020, 72 of 74 (97%) families approached for enrolment participated in the survey. A vast majority (95%) of parents appreciated the program and 93% would participate again. Among children > 7 years, 86% preferred receiving inhaled short-acting beta-agonist by their parents rather than by a healthcare provider.

Despite the impact of social expectations on toilet usage, few programs and studies have developed theoretically grounded norm-centric behavior change interventions to increase toilet use in low-income settings. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to detail the rationale and design of an ex ante, parallel cluster-randomized trial evaluating the impact of a demand-side, norm-centric behavior change intervention on exclusive toilet use and maintenance in peri-urban Tamil Nadu, India. METHODS: Following formative research, we developed an evidence-based norm-centric behavior change intervention called Nam Nalavazhvu (Tamil for “our well-being”). The multilevel intervention aims to improve toilet usage by shifting empirical expectations or beliefs about other relevant people’s sanitation practices. It also provides action-oriented information to aid individuals to set goals and overcome barriers to own, consistently use, and maintain their toilets. This trial includes 76 wards in the Pudukkottai and Karur districts, where half were randomly assigned to receive the intervention and the remaining served as counterfactuals. RESULTS: We enrolled wards and conducted a baseline survey among randomly selected individuals in all 76 wards. The 1-year behavior change intervention is currently ongoing. At the endline, we will collect relevant data and compare results between study arms to determine the impacts of the Nam Nalavazhvu intervention on sanitation-related behavioral, health, and well-being outcomes and potential moderators. This study is powered to detect differences in the prevalence of exclusive toilet use between study arms. We are also conducting a process evaluation to understand the extent to which the intervention was implemented as designed, given the special pandemic context.

METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 136 trauma patients, plasma samples obtained with high time resolution (admission, 2, 4, 6, 8 h, and thereafter daily) were assessed for terminal complement complex (TCC). We studied individual TCC concentration curves and calculated a summary measure to obtain the accumulated TCC response 3 to 6 h after injury (TCC-AUC(3–6)). Correlation analyses and multivariable linear regression analyses were used to explore associations between individual patients’ admission TCC, TCC-AUC(3–6), daily TCC during the intensive care unit stay, trauma characteristics, and predefined outcome measures. RESULTS: TCC concentration curves showed great variability in temporal shapes between individuals. However, the highest values were generally seen within the first 6 h after injury, before they subsided and remained elevated throughout the intensive care unit stay. Both admission TCC and TCC-AUC(3–6) correlated positively with New Injury Severity Score (Spearman’s rho, p-value 0.31, 0.0003 and 0.21, 0.02) and negatively with admission Base Excess (− 0.21, 0.02 and − 0.30, 0.001). Multivariable analyses confirmed that deranged physiology was an important predictor of complement activation. For patients without major head injury, admission TCC and TCC-AUC(3–6) were negatively associated with ventilator-free days. TCC-AUC(3–6) outperformed admission TCC as a predictor of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at day 0 and 4. CONCLUSIONS: Complement activation 3 to 6 h after injury was a better predictor of prolonged mechanical ventilation and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome than admission TCC. Our data suggest that the greatest surge of complement activation is found within the first 6 h after injury, and we argue that this time period should be in focus in the design of future experimental studies and clinical trials using complement inhibitors.

Complement system and pyroptosis have been proved to be involved in ALI, and inhibition of C5a/C5a receptor (C5aR) could alleviate ALI. This study aimed to investigate whether C5a/C5aR inhibition could protect against LPS-induced ALI via mediating pyroptosis. Rats were assigned into four groups: Control, LPS, LPS+W-54011 1mg/kg, and LPS+W-54011 5mg/kg. Beas-2B cells pretreated with or without C5a and W-54011, alone and in combination, were challenged with LPS+ATP. Results unveiled that LPS caused lung tissue injury and inflammatory response, increased pyroptotic and apoptotic factors, along with elevated C5a concentration and C5aR expressions. However, W-54011 pretreatment alleviated lung damage and pulmonary edema, reduced inflammation and prevented cell pyroptosis. In vitro studies confirmed that LPS+ATP reduced cell viability, promoted cell death, generated inflammatory factors and promoted expressions of pyroptosis-related proteins, which could be prevented by W-54011 pretreatment while intensified by C5a pretreatment. The co-treatment of C5a and W-54011 could blunt the effects of C5a on LPS+ATP-induced cytotoxicity. In conclusion, inhibition of C5a/C5aR developed protective effects against LPS-induced ALI and the cytotoxicity of Beas-2B cells, and these effects may depend on blocking pyroptosis.",2021-03-10,"Wang, Renying; Wang, Yunxing; Hu, Lan; Lu, Zhenbing; Wang, Xiaoshan",Aging (Albany NY),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b6ddbf775e5f5604d3a0a597573ae2b04e9520a4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8034960.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8034960/,

Water in the environment can be a source of infection linked to outbreaks and environmental transmission in hospitals. Water safety in hospitals remains a challenge. This article has summarized available scientific literature to obtain an overview of outbreaks linked to water-containing hospital equipment and strategies to prevent such outbreaks. METHODS: We made a list of water-containing hospital equipment and devices in which water is being used in a semi-closed circuit. A literature search was performed in PubMed with a search strategy containing the names of these medical devices and one or more of the following words: outbreak, environmental contamination, transmission, infection. For each medical device, we summarized the following information: the function of the medical device, causes of contamination, the described outbreaks and possible prevention strategies. RESULTS: The following water-containing medical equipment or devices were identified: heater-cooler units, hemodialysis equipment, neonatal incubators, dental unit waterlines, fluid warmers, nebulizers, water traps, water baths, blanketrol, scalp cooling, and thermic stimulators. Of the latter three, no literature could be found. Of all other devices, one or more outbreaks associated with these devices were reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: The water reservoirs in water-containing medical devices can be a source of microbial growth and transmissions to patients, despite the semi-closed water circuit. Proper handling and proper cleaning and disinfection can help to reduce the microbial burden and, consequently, transmission to patients. However, these devices are often difficult to clean and disinfect because they cannot be adequately opened or disassembled, and the manufacturer’s cleaning guidelines are often not feasible to execute. The development of equipment without water or fluid containers should be stimulated. Precise cleaning and disinfection guidelines and instructions are essential for instructing healthcare workers and hospital cleaning staff to prevent potential transmission to patients.",2021-05-10,"Yiek, Wing-Kee; Coenen, Olga; Nillesen, Mayke; van Ingen, Jakko; Bowles, Edmée; Tostmann, Alma",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/270cd3b433148c721dad51ba11695e627b30bee4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8108015.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8108015/,

However, a pharmacological evaluation of QLP on ovarian function remains to be conducted, and the key mechanism of QLP treatment on POI is unclear. METHODS: Premature ovarian insufficiency rats were established by bilateral partial ovariectomy. The model rats were administrated with low (QLP-L), medium (QLP-M) and high (QLP-H) doses of QLP for 4 weeks to evaluate the ovarian function in terms of estrous cycle, hormone level, and follicle count. The mechanism of QLP in the treatment of POI was systematically explored by network pharmacology, and expression levels of the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways were verified by Western blotting and molecular docking. RESULTS: The rat model of resection-induced POI was successfully established, and QLP could significantly recover the estrous cycle, decrease serum FSH levels, and decelerate follicle depletion after 4 weeks of administration. The optimal dose of QLP in the experiment was preliminarily determined to be 0.9 g/kg. Based on the network pharmacology methods, we constructed the compound-target network and protein protein interaction (PPI) network of QLP for the treatment of POI. The experimental verification of the enrichment analysis showed that QLP inhibited the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, and the key compounds and key targets involved were verified by molecular docking. CONCLUSION: QLP exerted significant therapeutic effects on resection-induced POI rats, and this was achieved by the inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways.

However, the potential roles of sarcinae as commensals or pathogens remain unclear. Here, we investigate a lethal disease of unknown etiology that affects sanctuary chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Sierra Leone. The disease, which we have named “epizootic neurologic and gastroenteric syndrome” (ENGS), is characterized by neurologic and gastrointestinal signs and results in death of the animals, even after medical treatment. Using a case-control study design, we show that ENGS is strongly associated with Sarcina infection. The microorganism is distinct from Sarcina ventriculi and other known members of its genus, based on bacterial morphology and growth characteristics. Whole-genome sequencing confirms this distinction and reveals the presence of genetic features that may account for the unusual virulence of the bacterium. Therefore, we propose that this organism be considered the representative of a new species, named “Candidatus Sarcina troglodytae”.

A substantial proportion of these people (44%-64%) develop persistent symptoms that are challenging to treat, costly, and associated with significant disability. Anxiety has emerged as a risk factor for progression from acute to persistent mTBI symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop, adapt, and establish the feasibility of the Toolkit for Optimal Recovery after Concussions (TOR-C), an innovative mind-body program aimed at preventing persistent symptoms among young adults with mTBI and comorbid anxiety. Here, we describe the proposed study design, methodology, measurement, and treatment manuals. METHODS: In phase 1, we will conduct individual, live video qualitative interviews (up to n=20) with college-aged individuals with mTBI and comorbid anxiety to inform adaptation of the intervention and study procedures. In phase 2, an open pilot of the live video TOR-C (n=5) with exit interviews will be conducted to explore the initial feasibility, acceptability, and credibility of the program and to refine the study procedures. Phase 3 will involve conducting a feasibility randomized controlled trial (N=50) of the TOR-C versus a health education control (Health Enhancement for Concussions; HE-C), both delivered via live video, to establish feasibility of recruitment procedures (screening, eligibility, and enrollment) and data collection; feasibility, credibility, and acceptability of the live video TOR-C and HE-C (adherence, retention, fidelity, and satisfaction) following prespecified benchmarks; and a signal of improvement in outcomes. RESULTS: Phase 1 of the study has been approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board. Study completion is anticipated by early 2025. CONCLUSIONS: We will develop and test the first mind-body intervention focused on prevention of persistent symptoms following mTBI in young adults with comorbid anxiety problems. This will allow us to establish feasibility markers in postconcussive symptoms, anxiety, disability, and fear avoidance to inform a future efficacy trial of the TOR-C versus HE-C.

This report presents a rare case of acute transverse myelopathy which unveiled previously undiagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis in an adult rural Indian male. The patient responded well to anti-tubercular therapy and corticosteroids. Exact pathogenesis of LETM in TB remains elusive. Association of TB with MOG-EM has been one of the recent hot-cakes.

Previous studies have shown that cigarette smoke dysregulated metabolites; however, limited information is available with electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping. We hypothesized that e-cig vaping and cigarette smoking alters systemic metabolites, and we propose to understand the specific metabolic signature between e-cig users and cigarette smokers. Plasma from non-smoker controls, cigarette smokers, and e-cig users was collected, and metabolites were identified by UPLC-MS (ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer). Nicotine degradation was activated by e-cig vaping and cigarette smoking with increased concentrations of cotinine, cotinine N-oxide, (S)-nicotine, and (R)-6-hydroxynicotine. Additionally, we found significantly decreased concentrations in metabolites associated with tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle pathways in e-cig users versus cigarette smokers, such as d-glucose, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylmalate, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, O-phosphoethanolamine, malathion, d-threo-isocitrate, malic acid, and 4-acetamidobutanoic acid.

Overall, e-cig vaping dysregulated TCA cycle-related metabolites while cigarette smoking altered sphingolipid metabolites. Both e-cig and cigarette smoke increased nicotinic metabolites.

However, research on the use of exposure therapy in clinical practice has presented mixed results, potentially due to differences in samples and training programs across countries. The present study aimed to extend upon existing research by examining the use and predictors of use of exposure therapy in a sample of psychologists working in clinical practice in Australia who treat clients with an anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: One hundred registered psychologists (M(age) = 40.60; SD = 10.78; range 23 to 71 years; 84% female) participated in an online study investigating their clinical practices. RESULTS: Results suggested that while the general use of exposure therapy is high, the use of disorder specific techniques was considerably lower, particularly for anxiety disorders and PTSD but not OCD. Psychology registration status and level of training were positively associated with use of exposure therapy as was the experience in treating anxiety disorders. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that further or ongoing professional training may be required to optimize the use of disorder specific techniques.

However, culturally tailored interventions for this population have been slow to emerge. OBJECTIVE: This type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial examines the feasibility and efficacy of a gamified, culturally tailored, personalized normative feedback (PNF) alcohol intervention for sexual minority women who psychologically identify as lesbian, bisexual, or queer (LBQ). METHODS: The core components of a PNF intervention were delivered within LezParlay, a fun, social media–inspired, digital competition designed to challenge negative stereotypes about LBQ women and increase visibility. The competition was advertised on the web through social media platforms and collaboration with LBQ community organizations. After 2 rounds of play by a large cohort of LBQ women, a subsample of 500 drinkers already taking part in the competition were invited to participate in the evaluation study. Study participants were randomized to receive 1 of 3 unique sequences of PNF (ie, alcohol and stigma coping, alcohol and control, or control topics only) over 2 intervention rounds. Randomization was fully automated by the web app, and both researchers and participants were blinded. RESULTS: Analyses will evaluate whether PNF on alcohol use reduces participants’ drinking and negative consequences at 2 and 4 months postintervention; examine whether providing PNF on stigma-coping behaviors, in addition to alcohol use, further reduces alcohol use and consequences beyond PNF on alcohol alone; identify mediators and moderators of intervention efficacy; and examine broader LezParlay app engagement, acceptability, and perceived benefits. CONCLUSIONS: This incognito intervention approach is uniquely oriented toward engaging and preventing alcohol-related risks among community populations of LBQ women who may view their heavy drinking as normative and not in need of change because of the visibility of alcohol use in sexual minority community spaces. Thus, this intervention strategy diverges from, and is intended to complement, more intensive programs being developed to meet the needs of LBQ women already motivated to reduce their consumption.

Hence, increasing vaccination rates is an important policy goal within the EU and worldwide. We aim to evaluate individual and systemic parameters associated with vaccination in European Union citizens aged 55 or older, using data from the Special Eurobarometer 488. Methods: Linear probability and probit models are estimated to analyze the determinants of vaccination take-up. Further, descriptive analyses are used to explore how the reasons for not having a vaccination differ by welfare regime. Results: High knowledge about the effectiveness and safety of vaccination increases the probability of receiving a vaccination during the past five years by 26 percentage points (pp), medium knowledge increases it by 15 pp. Focusing on the specific case of the flu, official recommendations increase this probability by, on average, 6 pp; while having to pay out-of-pocket for a recommended vaccination decreases it by, on average, 10 pp. Furthermore, the differences for no vaccination differ widely across welfare systems and television is the primary source for information about vaccination.

Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) are related to prolonged hospitalizations. Present study explored whether the use of sugammadex could reduce PPCs and thereby reduce hospital length of stay (LOS) after lung surgery. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent elective open lobectomy for lung cancer from January 2010 to December 2015. Patients were divided into the sugammadex group and pyridostigmine group. The primary outcome was hospital LOS and secondary outcomes were postoperative complications and overall survival at 1 year. The cohort was subdivided into patients with and without prolonged LOS to explore the effects of sugammadex on outcomes in each group. Risk factors for LOS were determined via multivariate analyses. After propensity score matching, 127 patients were assigned to each group. RESULTS: Median hospital LOS was shorter (10.0 vs. 12.0 days) and the incidence of postoperative atelectasis was lower (18.1 vs. 29.9%) in the sugammadex group. However, no significant difference in overall survival between the groups was seen over 1 year (hazard ratio, 0.967; 95% confidence interval, 0.363 to 2.577). Sugammadex was a predictor related to LOS (exponential coefficient 0.88; 95% CI 0.82–0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that sugammadex is a preferable agent for neuromuscular blockade (NMB) reversal than cholinesterase inhibitors in this patient population.

These disorders cause debilitating symptoms, have a significant impact on quality of life, and are poorly managed. The activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been proposed to have a major influence on the inflammatory signalling pathways of the intestinal tract. Inhibition of TLR4 has been postulated as an effective way to treat intestinal inflammation. However, there are a limited number of studies looking into the potential of TLR4 antagonism as a therapeutic approach for intestinal inflammation. This review surveyed available literature and reported on the in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo effects of TLR4 antagonism on different models of intestinal inflammation. Of the studies reviewed, evidence suggests that there is indeed potential for TLR4 antagonists to treat inflammation, although only a limited number of studies have investigated treating intestinal inflammation with TLR4 antagonists directly.

We previously showed that treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected mice with 5-OP-RU, a major antigen for MAIT cells, expands MAIT cells and enhances bacterial control. Here we treated M. tuberculosis infected rhesus macaques with 5-OP-RU intratracheally but found no clinical or microbiological benefit. In fact, after 5-OP-RU treatment MAIT cells did not expand, but rather upregulated PD-1 and lost the ability to produce multiple cytokines, a phenotype resembling T cell exhaustion. Furthermore, we show that vaccination of uninfected macaques with 5-OP-RU+CpG instillation into the lungs also drives MAIT cell dysfunction, and PD-1 blockade during vaccination partly prevents the loss of MAIT cell function without facilitating their expansion. Thus, in rhesus macaques MAIT cells are prone to the loss of effector functions rather than expansion after TCR stimulation in vivo, representing a significant barrier to therapeutically targeting these cells.",2021-06-22,"Sakai, Shunsuke; Lora, Nickiana E.; Kauffman, Keith D.; Dorosky, Danielle E.; Oh, Sangmi; Namasivayam, Sivaranjani; Gomez, Felipe; Fleegle, Joel D.; Arlehamn, Cecilia S.

Here we examine if the Sig-1R may relate to neuropathic pain at the level of dorsal root ganglia (DRG). We focus on the neuronal excitability of DRG in a “spare nerve injury” (SNI) model of neuropathic pain in rats and find that Sig-1Rs likely contribute to the genesis of DRG neuronal excitability by decreasing the protein level of voltage-gated Cav2.2 as a translational inhibitor of mRNA. Specifically, during SNI, Sig-1Rs translocate from ER to the nuclear envelope via a trafficking protein Sec61β. At the nucleus, the Sig-1R interacts with cFos and binds to the promoter of 4E-BP1, leading to an upregulation of 4E-BP1 that binds and prevents eIF4E from initiating the mRNA translation for Cav2.2. Interestingly, in Sig-1R knockout HEK cells, Cav2.2 is upregulated. In accordance with those findings, we find that intra-DRG injection of Sig-1R agonist (+)pentazocine increases frequency of action potentials via regulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Conversely, intra-DRG injection of Sig-1R antagonist BD1047 attenuates neuropathic pain. Hence, we discover that the Sig-1R chaperone causes neuropathic pain indirectly as a translational inhibitor.

Outcomes from ICU and prediction models are not well explored in Rwanda owing to lack of appropriate scores. This study aimed to assess reasons for admission and accuracy of prediction models for mortality of obstetric patients admitted to ICUs of two public tertiary hospitals in Rwanda. METHODS: We prospectively collected data from all obstetric patients admitted to the ICUs of the two public tertiary hospitals in Rwanda from March 2017 to February 2018 to identify reasons for admission, demographic and clinical characteristics, outcome including death and its predictability by both the Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score (MEOWS) and quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA). We analysed the accuracy of mortality prediction models by MEOWS or qSOFA by using logistic regression adjusting for factors associated with mortality. Area under the Receiver Operating characteristic (AUROC) curves is used to show the predicting capacity for each individual tool. RESULTS: Obstetric patients (n = 94) represented 12.8 % of all 747 ICU admissions which is 1.8 % of all 4.999 admitted women for pregnancy or labor. Sepsis (n = 30; 31.9 %) and obstetric haemorrhage (n = 24; 25.5 %) were the two commonest reasons for ICU admission. Overall ICU mortality for obstetric patients was 54.3 % (n = 51) with average length of stay of 6.6 ± 7.525 days. MEOWS score was an independent predictor of mortality (adjusted (a)OR 1.25; 95 % CI 1.07–1.46) and so was qSOFA score (aOR 2.81; 95 % CI 1.25–6.30) with an adjusted AUROC of 0.773 (95 % CI 0.67–0.88) and 0.764 (95 % CI 0.65–0.87), indicating fair accuracy for ICU mortality prediction in these settings of both MEOWS and qSOFA scores. CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis and obstetric haemorrhage were the commonest reasons for obstetric admissions to ICU in Rwanda.

Moreover, intuitive data visualization is a central feature in exploring, interpreting, and extracting specific insights for subsequent numerical data representation. This integrated process is normally based on the definition of relevant metrics and specific performance indicators, both computed upon continuous real-time data, considering the specificities of a particular application case for data validation. This article presents an IoT-oriented evaluation tool for Radon Risk Management (RRM), based on the design of a simple and intuitive Indoor Radon Risk Exposure Indicator (IRREI), specifically tailored to be used as a decision-making aid tool for building owners, building designers, and buildings managers, or simply as an alert flag for the problem awareness of ordinary citizens. The proposed methodology was designed for graphic representation aligned with the requirements of the current IoT age, i.e., the methodology is robust enough for continuous data collection with specific Spatio-temporal attributes and, therefore, a set of adequate Radon risk-related metrics can be extracted and proposed. Metrics are summarized considering the application case, taken as a case study for data validation, by including relevant variables to frame the study, such as the regulatory International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) dosimetric limits, building occupancy (spatial dimension), and occupants’ exposure periods (temporal dimension).

The combined effects of general anaesthesia and positive pressure ventilation can aggravate this condition and cause increased pulmonary blood pressures, reduced systemic blood pressures and ventricular contractility. Although perioperative use of inotropic support or vasopressors is almost mandatory for these patients, preference is disputed. In this study, we investigated the effects of norepinephrine and dobutamine and their ability to improve the arterio-ventricular relationship and haemodynamics in pigs suffering from chronic pulmonary hypertension. METHOD: Pulmonary hypertension was induced in five pigs by banding the pulmonary artery at 2–3 weeks of age. Six pigs served as controls. After 16 weeks of pulmonary artery banding, the animals were re-examined under general anaesthesia using biventricular conductance catheters and a pulmonary artery catheter. After baseline measurements, the animals were exposed to both norepinephrine and dobutamine infusions in incremental doses, with a stabilising period in between the infusions. The hypothesis of differences between norepinephrine and dobutamine with incremental doses was tested using repeated two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparisons post-test. RESULTS: At baseline, pulmonary artery-banded animals had increased right ventricular pressure (+ 39%, p = 0.04), lower cardiac index (− 23% p = 0.04), lower systolic blood pressure (− 13%, p = 0.02) and reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume (− 33%, p = 0.02). When incremental doses of norepinephrine and dobutamine were administered, the right ventricular arterio-ventricular coupling was improved only by dobutamine (p < 0.05). Norepinephrine increased both left ventricular end-diastolic volume and left ventricular contractility to a greater extent (p < 0.05) in pulmonary artery-banded animals. While the cardiac index was improved equally by norepinephrine and dobutamine treatments in pulmonary artery-banded animals, norepinephrine had a significantly greater effect on mean arterial pressure (p < 0.05) and diastolic arterial pressure (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: While norepinephrine and dobutamine improved cardiac index equally, it was obtained in different manners. Dobutamine significantly improved the right ventricular function and the arterio-ventricular coupling. Norepinephrine increased systemic resistance, thereby improving arterial pressures and left ventricular systolic function by maintaining left ventricular end-diastolic volume.",2021-06-04,"Hyldebrandt, Janus Adler; Bøgh, Nikolaj; Omann, Camilla; Agger, Peter",Intensive Care Med Exp,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/824b29047ad09df02139359f046defd475d96f20.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8175098.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175098/,

Hutong neighborhoods in Beijing, capital of China, cannot be rebuilt due to the protection of historical heritage, while residents still need to keep the habit of defecating in public toilets. One hundred public toilets with non-sewered sanitation in the Hutong neighborhoods of Beijing were visited to investigate the actual operating status in response to the “toilet revolution” campaign. The fault tree approach was used to identify the barriers toward a decent and environment-friendly public toilet and evaluate potential risks from the malfunction of various components. Four subsystems are defined and elaborated to calculate the fault possibility. These subsystems are environment- and user-friendly, regarded as ancillary facilities, and used for fecal sludge (FS) management. Statistical analysis of targeted cases indicated that fault probabilities of environmental considerations, user-friendly considerations, ancillary facilities, FS management are calculated as 0.79, 0.96, 0.96, and 0, respectively. The subsystems were weighted using a Delphi method concept. Results showed that the well operation ratio of Beijing Hutong public toilets is only 32%, and the sanitation service value chain can be further optimized.

Although compression bandaging is the principal treatment, it is time-consuming and bandage application requires specific training. There is evidence that intervention on superficial venous incompetence can help ulcer healing and recurrence, but this is not accessible to all patients. Hence, new treatments are required to address these chronic wounds. One possible adjuvant treatment for VLU is human decellularised dermis (DCD), a type of skin graft derived from skin from deceased tissue donors. Although DCD has the potential to promote ulcer healing, there is a paucity of data for its use in patients with VLU. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, parallel group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial. One hundred and ninety-six patients with VLU will be randomly assigned to receive either the DCD allograft in addition to standard care or standard care alone. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with a healed index ulcer at 12 weeks post-randomisation in each treatment arm. Secondary outcomes include the time to index ulcer healing and the proportion of participants with a healed index ulcer at 12 months. Changes in quality of life scores and cost-effectiveness will also be assessed. All analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. A mixed-effects, logistic regression on the outcome of the proportion of those with the index ulcer healed at 12 weeks will be performed. Secondary outcomes will be assessed using various statistical models appropriate to the distribution and nature of these outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was granted by the Bloomsbury Research Ethics Committee (19/LO/1271).

To address this in a scalable way, we sought to develop a web tool that could help enhance underserved minority participation in clinical research. METHODS: We used our research literacy support flashcard tool as the initial prototype for human-centered design and usability testing of the web tool Health for All in public library settings. After forming partnerships with leadership from Chicago Public Libraries (CPL), local medical libraries, and the Chicago Department of Public Health, we conducted seven iterative design sessions with focus groups of library patrons and library staff from six CPL branches serving underserved communities followed by two rounds of usability testing and website modification. RESULTS: Based on the qualitative research findings from Design Sessions 1–7, we enacted the design decision of a website that was a hybrid of fact-filled and vignette (personal stories) paper prototypes divided into 4 modules (trust, diversity, healthy volunteers, pros/cons), each with their own outcome metrics. The website was thus constructed, and navigation issues identified in two rounds of usability testing by library patrons were addressed through further website modification, followed by the launch of a beta version of a hybridized single-scrolling and guided module prototype to allow further development with website analytics.

This paper presents a systematic review of the existing literature and reports on a large case series comparing implant fractures between the Exeter V40 series; 125 mm and conventional length stem systems. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. In parallel, we performed a retrospective single centre study of Exeter V40 femoral stem prosthetic fractures between April 2003 and June 2020. RESULTS: There are 25 reported cases of such prosthetic fractures confined to small case series and case reports within the literature. We report an additional 19 cases to the literature (mean age 66.3 years (SD 11.7); 12 (63%) females; BMI 32.9 kg/m(2) (SD 5.9)). The mean time from index procedure to fracture was 7.8 years (SD 3.6; 2.5 to 16.3). Exeter V40 stem fracture incidence was 0.15% and 1.21% for primary and revision arthroplasty, respectively. Incidence was significantly higher in revision arthroplasty (p < 0.001) and 125 mm length stems compared to ≥ 150 mm length stems (1.25% vs 0.13%, respectively; p < 0.001). When comparing different stem length cohorts, 125 mm short-stems were associated with stem-body fractures (92% vs 29%; p = 0.0095), earlier time to fracture (6.2 years vs 11.0 years; p = 0.0018), younger patient age at time of fracture (62.7 years vs 72.6 years; p = 0.037), and female sex (75% vs 43%; p = 0.326). CONCLUSION: This complication remains rare, although we report a significantly higher incidence at up to 17 years follow-up than in the literature. Short 125 mm length Exeter V40 stems undoubtedly have a role in restoring anatomy and biomechanics in smaller femoral geometries, although the surgeon has to appreciate the higher risk of stem fracture and the associated predisposing factors which may necessitate particular attention to surgical technique and planning.

PROCare4Life (Personalized Integrated Care Promoting Quality of Life for Older Adults) is a European project that recognizes the benefit of technology-based integrated care models in improving the care coordination and the quality of life of these target groups. This project proposes an integrated, scalable, and interactive care platform targeting older people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, their caregivers, and socio-health professionals. PROCare4Life adopts a user-centered design approach from the early stage and throughout platform development and implementation, during which the platform is designed and adapted to the needs and requirements of all the involved users. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the study protocol for investigating users’ needs and requirements regarding the design of the proposed PROCare4Life platform. METHODS: A mixed qualitative and quantitative study design is utilized, including online surveys, interviews, and workshops. The study aimed to recruit approximately 200 participants, including patients diagnosed with dementia or Parkinson disease, caregivers, socio-health professionals, and other stakeholders, from five different European countries: Germany, Italy, Portugal, Romania, and Spain. RESULTS: The study took place between April and September 2020.

The speed and accuracy of sharing these data could be greatly improved through the adoption of a data standard for information about health professionals. To date, however, no internationally accepted standard has emerged for this purpose. PURPOSE: This study examines three existing XML standards designed for the representation of individual worker data to determine if, and to what degree, each could be used for the tracking of health professionals. METHODS: The data elements of the Europass schema, the HR Open Standard Recruiting specification, and the MedBiquitous Healthcare Professional Profile standard were fully examined and matching elements were mapped to the 200+ elements identified from a prior content analysis as required by a sample of 20 international regulatory agencies. RESULTS: None of the schemas examined addressed more than half of the information elements required by regulators.

Improved methods for identifying and monitoring foci of active malaria transmission are needed in areas of low parasite prevalence in order to achieve malaria elimination. Serological assays can provide population-level infection history to inform elimination campaigns. METHODS: A bead-based multiplex antibody detection assay was used to evaluate a chimeric Plasmodium vivax MSP1 protein (PvRMC-MSP1), designed to be broadly immunogenic for use in vaccine studies, to act as a pan-malaria serological tool based on its ability to capture IgG in plasma samples obtained from naturally exposed individuals. Samples from 236 US travellers with PCR confirmed infection status from all four major Plasmodium species infecting humans, Plasmodium falciparum (n = 181), Plasmodium vivax (n = 38), Plasmodium malariae (n = 4), and Plasmodium ovale (n = 13) were tested for IgG capture using PvRMC-MSP1 as well as the four recombinant MSP1-19 kD isoforms representative of these Plasmodium species. RESULTS: Regardless of infecting Plasmodium species, a large proportion of plasma samples from infected US travellers provided a high assay signal to the PvRMC-MSP1 chimeric protein, with 115 high responders out of 236 samples assessed (48.7%). When grouped by active infection, 38.7% P. falciparum-, 92.1% of P. vivax-, 75.0% P. malariae-, and 53.4% of P. ovale-infected individuals displayed high assay signals in response to PvRMC-MSP1. It was also determined that plasma from P. vivax-infected individuals produced increased assay signals in response to the PvRMC-MSP1 chimera as compared to the recombinant PvMSP1 for 89.5% (34 out of 38) of individuals. PvRMC-MSP1 also showed improved ability to capture IgG antibodies from P. falciparum-infected individuals when compared to the capture by recombinant PvMSP1, with high assay signals observed for 38.7% of P. falciparum-infected travellers in response to PvRMC-MSP1 IgG capture compared to just 1.1% who were high responders to capture by the recombinant PvMSP1 protein. CONCLUSIONS: These results support further study of designed antigens as an approach for increasing sensitivity or broadening binding capacity to improve existing serological tools for determining population-level exposure to Plasmodium species. Including both broad-reacting and Plasmodium species-specific antigen-coated beads in an assay panel could provide a nuanced view of population-level exposure histories, an extensive IgG profile, and detailed seroestimates. A more sensitive serological tool for detection of P. vivax exposure would aid malaria elimination campaigns in co-endemic areas and regions where P. vivax is the dominant parasite.",2021-02-12,"McCaffery, Jessica N.; Singh, Balwan; Nace, Douglas; Moreno, Alberto; Udhayakumar, Venkatachalam; Rogier, Eric",Malar J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/562337d283d85daa25bef804e09a9f3b938dfe95.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7880512.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880512/,

Despite the recommendations of the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the Ministry of Health of Iran to use C-KMC for eligible hospitalized neonates, this type of care is not performed due to implementation problems. This protocol aims to describe the design, implementation, and assessment of C-KMC in one tertiary hospital by means of participatory action research. METHODS: The objective of this study is to design and implement a C-KMC program for neonates that will be performed in two phases using a stages-of-change model. The first phase will be conducted in three consecutive activities of designing, implementing, and assessing the introduction of C-KMC. The second phase of the study has a before-and-after design to assess the effectiveness of C-KMC by comparing the length of preterm neonates’ stay in hospital and exclusive breastfeeding at discharge before and after implementing C-KMC. DISCUSSION: KMC is an important component of neonatal developmental care as part of family-centered care.

AIM: To describe NHS Heath Check attendance, new diagnoses, and treatment in relation to equity indicators. DESIGN AND SETTING: A nationally representative database derived from 1500 general practices from 2009–2017. METHOD: The authors compared NHS Health Check attendance and new diagnoses and treatments by age, sex, ethnic group, and deprivation. RESULTS: In 2013–2017, 590 218 (16.9%) eligible people aged 40–74 years attended an NHS Health Check and 2 902 598 (83.1%) did not attend. South Asian ethnic groups were most likely to attend compared to others, and females more than males. New diagnoses were more likely in attendees than non-attendees: hypertension 25/1000 in attendees versus 9/1000 in non-attendees; type 2 diabetes 8/1000 versus 3/1000; and chronic kidney disease (CKD) 7/1000 versus 4/1000. In people aged ≥65 years, atrial fibrillation was newly diagnosed in 5/1000 attendees and 3/1000 non-attendees, and for dementia 2/1000 versus 1/1000, respectively. Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and CKD were more likely in more deprived groups, and in South Asian, Black African, and Black Caribbean ethnic groups. Attendees were more likely to be prescribed statins (26/1000) than non-attendees (8/1000), and antihypertensive medicines (25/1000 versus 13/1000 non-attendees). However, of the 117 963 people with ≥10% CVD risk who were eligible for statins, only 9785 (8.3%) were prescribed them. CONCLUSION: Uptake of NHS Health Checks remains low. Attendees were more likely than non-attendees to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and CKD, and to receive treatment with statins and antihypertensives.

METHODS: In this prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned 106 patients with NAFLD and T2DM to receive empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 35), pioglitazone 30 mg (n = 34), or placebo (n = 37) for 24 weeks. Liver fat content and liver stiffness were measured using fibroscans. Body composition assessment was performed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans. The primary end point was change from baseline in liver steatosis, using the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score. RESULTS: A borderline significant decrease in CAP score was observed with empagliflozin compared to placebo, mean difference: − 29.6 dB/m (− 39.5 to − 19.6) versus − 16.4 dB/m (− 25.0 to − 7.8), respectively; p = 0.05. Using multivariate analysis, we observed a significant reduction in the placebo-corrected change in liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with empagliflozin compared to pioglitazone: − 0.77 kPa (− 1.45, − 0.09), p = 0.02, versus 0.01 kPa (95% CI − 0.70, 0.71, p = 0.98), p for comparison = 0.03. Changes in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HOMA2-IR, fibrosis-4 index (FIB4 index), NAFLD fibrosis score, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), android/gynecoid ratio (A/G ratio), and skeletal muscle index (SMI) were comparable between the two treatment groups, while significant reductions of the body weight and visceral fat area were observed only in the empagliflozin group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively) and both were increased in the placebo and pioglitazone groups. There were no serious adverse events in either group. CONCLUSION: Treatment for 24 weeks with empagliflozin, in contrast to pioglitazone, was associated with improvement of liver steatosis and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD and T2DM. In addition, body weight and abdominal fat area were decreased in the empagliflozin group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT), IRCT20190122042450N3.

However, whether air pollution (AP) serves as a risk factor for post-adolescent acne remains elusive. AIM: To determine the relationship between short-term AP exposure (within 7 days) and outpatient visits for post-adolescent acne. METHODS: Daily outpatient visit data for post-adolescent acne and routinely AP data between 2010 and 2013 were collected from Xi’an, China. A generalized additive regression model was used to analyze the relationship between outpatient visits for post-adolescent acne and short-term ambient AP exposure. The gender-specific analyses were conducted as well. RESULTS: Totally, 27,190 outpatient visits for post-adolescent acne were included. The results revealed that a 10 μg/m(3) increase in PM(10), SO(2), and NO(2) at lag 0–7 day was associated with the increase of outpatient visits for post-adolescent acne at 0.84% (95% CI: 0.53%, 1.16%), 1.61% (95% CI: 0.12%, 3.10%), and 3.50% (95% CI: 1.60%, 5.40%), respectively. The significant positive associations of PM(10), SO(2), and NO(2) were found at both single-lag models and moving average models. The gender-specific analyses showed that the effect estimates of PM(10) was stronger for females than for males, while there was no observed gender difference in the effects of SO(2) and NO(2).
